The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is a neural network architecture that includes an external memory component, allowing it to store and manipulate information in a way that is analogous to a traditional computer's memory. The NTM uses a differentiable attention mechanism to read from and write to this memory, allowing it to learn to perform complex tasks that require reasoning and memory. The NTM is trained using gradient descent, making it possible to learn its parameters from data.

The Forward-Forward Algorithm (FF) is a new learning procedure for neural networks that aims to replace the forward and backward passes of backpropagation with two forward passes, one with positive data and the other with negative data. Each layer in the network has its own objective function, which is to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for negative data, and the sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the goodness. The FF algorithm is different from backpropagation in that it does not require the computation of gradients or the storage of intermediate values, and it can be used in situations where the precise details of the forward computation are unknown.

Predictive coding is a framework that explains how the nervous system reduces redundancy and efficiently codes sensory information by transmitting only the unpredicted portions of an incoming signal. This framework provides a functional explanation for various neural responses and aspects of brain organization, such as center-surround response properties and biphasic temporal antagonism in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as oriented receptive fields and contextual effects in the higher visual system.

Predictive coding is a theory of brain function that suggests the brain's primary objective is to minimize prediction errors, which are the differences between predicted and actual sensory input. The theory proposes that the brain achieves this through a hierarchical network of layers, each making predictions about the activity of the layer below and passing prediction errors upwards to update higher-level predictions.
