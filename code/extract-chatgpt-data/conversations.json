The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets. The implementation is available at: \u30100\u2020https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers\u2020github.com\u3011\n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nThe deep learning community has been looking for alternatives to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for storing information. For example, linear memory networks use a linear autoencoder for sequences as a memory (Carta et\u00a0al., \u30101\u20202020\u3011). Additional memories for RNNs like holographic reduced representations (Danihelka et\u00a0al., \u30102\u20202016\u3011), tensor product representations (Schlag & Schmidhuber, \u30103\u20202018\u3011; Schlag et\u00a0al., \u30104\u20202019\u3011) and classical associative memories (extended to fast weight approaches) (Schmidhuber, \u30105\u20201992\u3011; Ba et\u00a0al., \u30106\u20202016a\u3011; \u30107\u2020b\u3011; Zhang & Zhou, \u30108\u20202017\u3011; Schlag et\u00a0al., \u30109\u20202021\u3011) have been suggested. Most approaches to new memories are based on attention. The neural Turing machine (NTM) is equipped with an external memory and an attention process (Graves et\u00a0al., \u301010\u20202014\u3011). Memory networks (Weston et\u00a0al., \u301011\u20202014\u3011) use an attention by first mapping a query and patterns into a space and then retrieving the pattern with the largest dot product. End to end memory networks (EMN) make this attention scheme differentiable by replacing through a (Sukhbaatar et\u00a0al., \u301012\u20202015a\u3011; \u301013\u2020b\u3011). EMN with dot products became very popular and implement a key-value attention (Daniluk et\u00a0al., \u301014\u20202017\u3011) for self-attention. An enhancement of EMN is the transformer (Vaswani et\u00a0al., \u301015\u20202017a\u3011; \u301016\u2020b\u3011) and its extensions (Dehghani et\u00a0al., \u301017\u20202018\u3011). The transformer has had a great impact on the natural language processing (NLP) community, in particular via the BERT models (Devlin et\u00a0al., \u301018\u20202018\u3011; \u301019\u20202019\u3011). \n\nContribution of this work: (i) introducing novel deep learning layers that are equipped with a memory via modern Hopfield networks, (ii) introducing a novel energy function and a novel update rule for continuous modern Hopfield networks that are differentiable and typically retrieve patterns after one update. Differentiability is required for gradient descent parameter updates and retrieval with one update is compatible with activating the layers of deep networks.\n\nWe suggest using modern Hopfield networks to store information or learned prototypes in different layers of neural networks. Binary Hopfield networks were introduced as associative memories that can store and retrieve patterns (Hopfield, \u301020\u20201982\u3011). A query pattern can retrieve the pattern to which it is most similar or an average over similar patterns. Hopfield networks seem to be an ancient technique, however, new energy functions improved their properties. The stability of spurious states or metastable states was sensibly reduced (Barra et\u00a0al., \u301021\u20202018\u3011). The largest and most impactful successes are reported on increasing the storage capacity of Hopfield networks. In a -dimensional space, the standard Hopfield model can store uncorrelated patterns without errors but only random patterns with for a fixed stable pattern or if all patterns are stable (McEliece et\u00a0al., \u301022\u20201987\u3011). The same bound holds for nonlinear learning rules (Mazza, \u301023\u20201997\u3011). Using tricks-of-trade and allowing small retrieval errors, the storage capacity is about (Crisanti et\u00a0al., \u301024\u20201986\u3011; Hertz et\u00a0al., \u301025\u20201991\u3011; Torres et\u00a0al., \u301026\u20202002\u3011). If the learning rule is not related to the Hebb rule, then up to patterns can be stored (Abu-Mostafa & StJacques, \u301027\u20201985\u3011). For Hopfield networks with non-zero diagonal matrices, the storage can be increased to (Folli et\u00a0al., \u301028\u20202017\u3011). In contrast to the storage capacity, the number of energy minima (spurious states, stable states) of Hopfield networks is exponential in (Tanaka & Edwards, \u301029\u20201980\u3011; Bruck & Roychowdhury, \u301030\u20201990\u3011; Wainrib & Touboul, \u301031\u20202013\u3011).\n\nThe standard binary Hopfield network has an energy function that can be expressed as the sum of interaction functions with . Modern Hopfield networks, also called \u201cdense associative memory\u201d (DAM) models, use an energy function with interaction functions of the form and, thereby, achieve a storage capacity proportional to (Krotov & Hopfield, \u301032\u20202016\u3011; \u301033\u20202018\u3011). The energy function of modern Hopfield networks makes them robust against adversarial attacks (Krotov & Hopfield, \u301033\u20202018\u3011). Modern binary Hopfield networks with energy functions based on interaction functions of the form even lead to storage capacity of , where all stored binary patterns are fixed points but the radius of attraction vanishes (Demircigil et\u00a0al., \u301034\u20202017\u3011). However, in order to integrate Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, it is necessary to make them differentiable, that is, we require continuous Hopfield networks (Hopfield, \u301035\u20201984\u3011; Koiran, \u301036\u20201994\u3011).\n\nTherefore, we generalize the energy function of Demircigil et\u00a0al. (\u301034\u20202017\u3011) that builds on exponential interaction functions to continuous patterns and states and obtain a new modern Hopfield network. We also propose a new update rule which ensures global convergence to stationary points of the energy (local minima or saddle points). We prove that our new modern Hopfield network typically retrieves patterns in one update step (-close to the fixed point) with an exponentially low error and has a storage capacity proportional to (reasonable settings for and are given in Theorem\u00a0\u301037\u20203\u3011). The retrieval of patterns with one update is important to integrate Hopfield networks in deep learning architectures, where layers are activated only once. Surprisingly, our new update rule is also the key-value attention as used in transformer and BERT models (see Fig.\u00a01). Our modern Hopfield networks can be integrated as a new layer in deep learning architectures for pooling, memory, prototype learning, and attention. We test these new layers on different benchmark datasets and tasks like immune repertoire classification.\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: We generalize the energy of binary modern Hopfield networks to continuous states while keeping fast convergence and storage capacity properties. We also propose a new update rule that minimizes the energy. The new update rule is the attention mechanism of the transformer. Formulae are modified to express as row vector. \u201c\u201d-sign means \u201ckeeps the properties\u201d.   \n\n##  2 Modern Hopfield Nets with Continuous States\n\n##### New energy function for continuous state Hopfield networks.\n\nIn order to integrate modern Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, we have to make them continuous. To allow for continuous states, we propose a new energy function that is a modification of the energy of modern Hopfield networks (Demircigil et\u00a0al., \u301034\u20202017\u3011). We also propose a new update rule which can be proven to converge to stationary points of the energy (local minima or saddle points).\n\nWe have stored (key) patterns represented by the matrix with the largest pattern . The state (query) pattern is . For exponential interaction functions, we need the log-sum-exp function () for \n\n  (1)  \n\nwhich is convex (see appendix Eq.\u00a0(461), and Lemma\u00a0\u301038\u2020A22\u3011). The energy function of the modern Hopfield networks for binary patterns and a binary state pattern is (Krotov & Hopfield, \u301032\u20202016\u3011). Here, is the interaction function, where gives the classical Hopfield network. The storage capacity is proportional to (Krotov & Hopfield, \u301032\u20202016\u3011). This model was generalized by Demircigil et\u00a0al. (\u301034\u20202017\u3011) to exponential interaction functions which gives the energy . This energy leads to an exponential storage capacity of for binary patterns. Furthermore, with a single update, the fixed point is recovered with high probability for random patterns. However, still this modern Hopfield network has binary states.\n\nWe generalize this energy function to continuous-valued patterns while keeping the properties of the modern Hopfield networks like the exponential storage capacity and the extremely fast convergence (see Fig.\u00a01). For the new energy we take the logarithm of the negative energy of modern Hopfield networks and add a quadratic term of the current state. The quadratic term ensures that the norm of the state vector remains finite and the energy is bounded. Classical Hopfield networks do not require to bound the norm of their state vector, since it is binary and has fixed length. We define the novel energy function as\n\n  (2)  \n\nWe have (see appendix Lemma\u00a0\u301039\u2020A1\u3011). Using , we define a novel update rule (see Fig.\u00a01):\n\n  (3)  \n\nThe next theorem states that the update rule Eq.\u00a0(3) converges globally. The proof uses the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) (Yuille & Rangarajan, \u301040\u20202002\u3011; \u301041\u20202003\u3011), which is equivalent to Legendre minimization (Rangarajan et\u00a0al., \u301042\u20201996\u3011; \u301043\u20201999\u3011) algorithms (Yuille & Rangarajan, \u301041\u20202003\u3011).\n\n######  Theorem 1.\n\nThe update rule Eq.\u00a0(3) converges globally: For , the energy for and a fixed point .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe update rule in Eq.\u00a0(3) is the CCCP for minimizing the energy , which is the sum of the convex and concave (see details in appendix Theorem\u00a0\u301044\u20201\u3011). Theorem\u00a02 in Yuille & Rangarajan (\u301040\u20202002\u3011) yields the global convergence property. Also, in Theorem\u00a02 in Sriperumbudur & Lanckriet (\u301045\u20202009\u3011) the global convergence of CCCP is proven via a rigorous analysis using Zangwill\u2019s global convergence theory of iterative algorithms. \u220e\n\nThe global convergence theorem only assures that for the energy for but not . The next theorem strengthens Zangwill\u2019s global convergence theorem (Meyer, \u301046\u20201976\u3011) and gives convergence results similar to those known for expectation maximization (Wu, \u301047\u20201983\u3011).\n\n######  Theorem 2.\n\nFor the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3) we have as , for some stationary point . Furthermore, and either converges or, in the other case, the set of limit points of is a connected and compact subset of , where and is the set of stationary points of the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3). If is finite, then any sequence generated by the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3) converges to some .\n\nFor a proof, see appendix Theorem\u00a0\u301048\u20202\u3011. Therefore, all the limit points of any sequence generated by the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3) are stationary points (local minima or saddle points) of the energy function . Either the iteration converges or, otherwise, the set of limit points is a connected and compact set.\n\nThe next theorem gives the results on the storage capacity of our new continuous state modern Hopfield network. We first define what we mean by storing and retrieving patterns using a modern Hopfield network with continuous states.\n\n######  Definition 1 (Pattern Stored and Retrieved).\n\nWe assume that around every pattern a sphere is given. We say is stored if there is a single fixed point to which all points converge, and for . We say is retrieved for a given if iteration (update rule) Eq.\u00a0(3) gives a point that is at least -close to the single fixed point . The retrieval error is .\n\nAs with classical Hopfield networks, we consider patterns on the sphere, i.e.\u00a0patterns with a fixed norm. For randomly chosen patterns, the number of patterns that can be stored is exponential in the dimension of the space of the patterns ().\n\n######  Theorem 3.\n\nWe assume a failure probability and randomly chosen patterns on the sphere with radius . We define , , and , where is the upper branch of the Lambert function (Olver et\u00a0al., \u301049\u20202010\u3011, \u301050\u2020(4.13)\u2020dlmf.nist.gov\u3011), and ensure . Then with probability , the number of random patterns that can be stored is\n\n  (4)  \n\nTherefore it is proven for with , , and () and proven for with , , , and ().\n\nFor a proof, see appendix Theorem\u00a0\u301051\u2020A5\u3011.\n\nThe next theorem states that the update rule typically retrieves patterns after one update. Retrieval of a pattern for fixed point and query is defined via an by , that is, the update is -close to the fixed point. Retrieval with one update is crucial to integrate modern Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, where layers are activated only once. First we need the concept of separation of a pattern. For pattern we define its separation to other patterns by:\n\n  (5)  \n\nThe update rule retrieves patterns with one update for well separated patterns, that is, patterns with large .\n\n######  Theorem 4.\n\nWith query , after one update the distance of the new point to the fixed point is exponentially small in the separation . The precise bounds using the Jacobian and its value in the mean value theorem are:\n\n  (6)  \n(7)  \n\nFor given and sufficient large , we have , that is, retrieval with one update.\n\nSee proof in appendix Theorem\u00a0\u301052\u2020A8\u3011.\n\nAt the same time, the retrieval error decreases exponentially with the separation .\n\n######  Theorem 5 (Exponentially Small Retrieval Error).\n\nThe retrieval error of pattern is bounded by\n\n  (8)  \n\nand for together with by\n\n  (9)  \n\nSee proof in appendix Theorem\u00a0\u301053\u2020A9\u3011.\n\n##### Metastable states and one global fixed point.\n\nSo far, we considered patterns that are well separated and the iteration converges to a fixed point which is near a pattern . If no pattern is well separated from the others, then the iteration converges to a global fixed point close to the arithmetic mean of the vectors. In this case the vector is close to uniform, that is, . If some vectors are similar to each other and well separated from all other vectors, then a metastable state near the similar vectors exists. Iterations that start near the metastable state converge to this metastable state, also if initialized by one of the similar patterns. For convergence proofs to one global fixed point and to metastable states see appendix Lemma\u00a0\u301054\u2020A7\u3011 and Lemma\u00a0\u301055\u2020A12\u3011, respectively.\n\n##### Hopfield update rule is attention of the transformer.\n\nThe Hopfield network update rule is the attention mechanism used in transformer and BERT models (see Fig.\u00a01). To see this, we assume stored (key) patterns and state (query) patterns that are mapped to the Hopfield space of dimension . We set , , and multiply the result of our update rule with . The matrices and combine the and as row vectors. We define the matrices , , and , where . If and is changed to a row vector, we obtain for the update rule Eq.\u00a0(3) multiplied by :\n\n  (10)  \n\nThe left part of Eq.\u00a0(10) is the transformer attention. In the transformer self-attention , and replaced by just . Besides the attention mechanism, Hopfield networks allow for other functionalities in deep network architectures, which we introduce via specific layers in the next section. The right part of Eq.\u00a0(10) serves to explain these specific layers.\n\n##  3 New Hopfield Layers for Deep Learning\n\nModern Hopfield networks with continuous states can be integrated into deep learning architectures, because they are continuous and differentiable with respect to their parameters. Furthermore, they typically retrieve patterns with one update, which is conform to deep learning layers that are activated only once. For these two reasons, modern Hopfield networks can serve as specialized layers in deep networks to equip them with memories. Below, we introduce three types of Hopfield layers: Hopfield, HopfieldPooling, and HopfieldLayer.

Right: A deep network, where layers ( ) are equipped with associative memories via Hopfield layers ( ).   \n\n##### Types of neural networks.\n\nWe consider two types of feed-forward neural networks: (I) Neural networks that propagate an activation vector from the input layer to the output layer. Examples are fully-connected or convolutional neural networks. (II) Neural networks that propagate a set of vectors from the input layer to the output layer, where each layer applies the same operation to each element of the set and the output layer may summarize the set via a vector. An example is the transformer. Recurrent neural networks are networks of type (I), which are iteratively applied to a set or a sequence, where intermediate results are stored in a memory and can be reused. Modern Hopfield networks can be integrated into both types of neural network architectures and enable to equip each of their layers with associative memories. See Fig.\u00a02.\n\n##### Types of new Hopfield layers.\n\nWe introduce three types of Hopfield layers: Hopfield, HopfieldPooling, and HopfieldLayer. The continuous modern Hopfield network results in a plethora of new deep learning architectures, since we can (a) propagate sets or single vectors, (b) propagate queries, stored patterns, or both, (c) learn static queries or stored patterns, (d) fill the memory by training sets, prototypes, or external data. Next, we provide three useful types of Hopfield layers. The implementation is available at: \u30100\u2020https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers\u2020github.com\u3011\n\n(1) Layer Hopfield for networks that propagate sets of vectors via state (query) patterns and stored (key) patterns . The layer Hopfield is the realization of formula\u00a0(10). The memory of the Hopfield layer can be filled with sets from the input or previous layers, see Fig.\u00a03. The memory may be filled with a reference set, which is covered by providing the reference set as additional input. Thus, the layer Hopfield allows the association of two sets. A prominent example of a layer that performs such association is the transformer attention mechanism, which associates keys and queries, e.g.\u00a0two point sets that have to be compared. This layer allows for different kinds of sequence-to-sequence learning, point set operations, and retrieval-based methods. The layer Hopfield with skip connections in a ResNet architecture is identical to the popular transformer and BERT models. In the experiments, we analyzed these Hopfield layers in transformer architectures. In our experiments in which we compare machine learning methods on small datasets of the UCI benchmark collection the layer Hopfield is also used.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 3: The layer Hopfield allows the association of two sets ( ) and ( ). It can be integrated into deep networks that propagate sets of vectors. The Hopfield memory is filled with a set from either the input or previous layers. The output is a set of vectors ( ). \n\n(2) Layer HopfieldPooling for networks that propagate patterns via the stored (key) patterns . This layer performs a pooling or summarization of sets obtained from queries in previous layers or the input. The memory of the HopfieldPooling layer is filled with sets from the input or previous layers. The HopfieldPooling layer uses the queries to search for patterns in the memory, the stored set. If more patterns are similar to a particular search pattern (query), then the result is an average over these patterns. The state (query) patterns of each layer are static and can be learned. Multiple queries supply a set to the next layer, where each query corresponds to one element of the set. Thus, the layer HopfieldPooling enables fixed pattern search, pooling operations, and memories like LSTMs or GRUs. The static pattern functionality is typically needed if particular patterns must be identified in the data.   \nA single HopfieldPooling layer allows for multiple instance learning. Static state (query) patterns together with position encoding in the keys allows for performing pooling operations. The position encoding can be two-dimensional, where standard convolutional filters can be constructed as in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The HopfieldPooling layer can substitute pooling, averaging, LSTM, and permutation equivariant layers. See Fig.\u00a04. The layer HopfieldPooling is used for experiments with multiple instance learning tasks, e.g.\u00a0for immune repertoire classification in the experiments.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 4: The layer HopfieldPooling enables pooling or summarization of sets, which are obtained from the input or from previous layers. The input ( ) can be either a set or a sequence. The query patterns of each layer are static and can be learned. The output is a set of vectors ( ), where the number of vectors equals the number of query patterns. The layer HopfieldPooling can realize multiple instance learning. \n\n(3) Layer HopfieldLayer for networks that propagate a vector or a set of vectors via state (query) patterns . The queries can be input vectors or queries that are computed from the output of previous layers. The memory of the HopfieldLayer layer is filled with a fixed set, which can be the training set, a reference set, prototype set, or a learned set (a learned matrix). The stored (key) patterns are static and can be learned. If the training set is stored in the memory, then each layer constructs a new set of queries based on the query results of previous layers. The stored patterns can be initialized by the training set or a reference set and then learned, in which case they deviate from the training set. The stored patterns can be interpreted as weights from the state (query) to hidden neurons that have a softmax activation function (Krotov & Hopfield, \u301070\u20202020\u3011). The layer HopfieldLayer can substitute a fully connected layer, see Fig.\u00a05. A single HopfieldLayer layer also allows for approaches similar to support vector machines (SVMs), approaches similar to -nearest neighbor, approaches similar to learning vector quantization, and pattern search. For classification, the raw data can be the concatenation of input and target . In this case, the matrices and can be designed such that inside the softmax the input is used and outside the softmax the target . Thus, the softmax provides a weighted average of the target vectors based on the similarity between the query and the inputs. Also SVM models, -nearest neighbor, and learning vector quantization can be considered as weighted averages of the targets. The encoder-decoder attention layer of the transformers are a HopfieldL\nVisible: 0% - 11%", "summary": "[2008.02217] Hopfield Networks is All You Need (ar5iv.org)\n", "assets": []}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "[2008.02217] Hopfield Networks is All You Need", "url": "https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2008.02217.pdf", "text": "\nURL: https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2008.02217.pdf\n# Hopfield Networks is All You Need\n\nHubert Ramsauer^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Johannes Lehner^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Philipp Seidl^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1   \nMichael Widrich^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Thomas Adler^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Lukas Gruber^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Markus Holzleitner^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1   \nMilena Pavlovi\u0107^{3}^{3}footnotemark: 3\u00a0^{4}^{4}footnotemark: 4 Geir Kjetil Sandve^{4}^{4}footnotemark: 4 Victor Greiff^{3}^{3}footnotemark: 3 David Kreil^{2}^{2}footnotemark: 2   \nMichael Kopp^{2}^{2}footnotemark: 2 G\u00fcnter Klambauer^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Johannes Brandstetter^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1 Sepp Hochreiter^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1\u00a0^{2}^{2}footnotemark: 2   \n^{1}^{1}footnotemark: 1\u00a0\u00a0ELLIS Unit Linz, LIT AI Lab, Institute for Machine Learning,   \n\u00a0\u00a0Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria   \n^{2}^{2}footnotemark: 2\u00a0\u00a0Institute of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence (IARAI)   \n^{3}^{3}footnotemark: 3\u00a0\u00a0Department of Immunology, University of Oslo, Norway   \n^{4}^{4}footnotemark: 4\u00a0\u00a0Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Norway \n\n###### Abstract\n\nWe introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers\n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nThe deep learning community has been looking for alternatives to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for storing information. For example, linear memory networks use a linear autoencoder for sequences as a memory (Carta et\u00a0al., 2020). Additional memories for RNNs like holographic reduced representations (Danihelka et\u00a0al., 2016), tensor product representations (Schlag & Schmidhuber, 2018; Schlag et\u00a0al., 2019) and classical associative memories (extended to fast weight approaches) (Schmidhuber, 1992; Ba et\u00a0al., 2016a; b; Zhang & Zhou, 2017; Schlag et\u00a0al., 2021) have been suggested. Most approaches to new memories are based on attention. The neural Turing machine (NTM) is equipped with an external memory and an attention process (Graves et\u00a0al., 2014). Memory networks (Weston et\u00a0al., 2014) use an attention by first mapping a query and patterns into a space and then retrieving the pattern with the largest dot product. End to end memory networks (EMN) make this attention scheme differentiable by replacing through a (Sukhbaatar et\u00a0al., 2015a; b). EMN with dot products became very popular and implement a key-value attention (Daniluk et\u00a0al., 2017) for self-attention. An enhancement of EMN is the transformer (Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017a; b) and its extensions (Dehghani et\u00a0al., 2018). The transformer has had a great impact on the natural language processing (NLP) community, in particular via the BERT models (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; 2019). \n\nContribution of this work: (i) introducing novel deep learning layers that are equipped with a memory via modern Hopfield networks, (ii) introducing a novel energy function and a novel update rule for continuous modern Hopfield networks that are differentiable and typically retrieve patterns after one update. Differentiability is required for gradient descent parameter updates and retrieval with one update is compatible with activating the layers of deep networks.\n\nWe suggest using modern Hopfield networks to store information or learned prototypes in different layers of neural networks. Binary Hopfield networks were introduced as associative memories that can store and retrieve patterns (Hopfield, 1982). A query pattern can retrieve the pattern to which it is most similar or an average over similar patterns. Hopfield networks seem to be an ancient technique, however, new energy functions improved their properties. The stability of spurious states or metastable states was sensibly reduced (Barra et\u00a0al., 2018). The largest and most impactful successes are reported on increasing the storage capacity of Hopfield networks. In a -dimensional space, the standard Hopfield model can store uncorrelated patterns without errors but only random patterns with for a fixed stable pattern or if all patterns are stable (McEliece et\u00a0al., 1987). The same bound holds for nonlinear learning rules (Mazza, 1997). Using tricks-of-trade and allowing small retrieval errors, the storage capacity is about (Crisanti et\u00a0al., 1986; Hertz et\u00a0al., 1991; Torres et\u00a0al., 2002). If the learning rule is not related to the Hebb rule, then up to patterns can be stored (Abu-Mostafa & StJacques, 1985). For Hopfield networks with non-zero diagonal matrices, the storage can be increased to (Folli et\u00a0al., 2017). In contrast to the storage capacity, the number of energy minima (spurious states, stable states) of Hopfield networks is exponential in (Tanaka & Edwards, 1980; Bruck & Roychowdhury, 1990; Wainrib & Touboul, 2013).\n\nThe standard binary Hopfield network has an energy function that can be expressed as the sum of interaction functions with . Modern Hopfield networks, also called \u201cdense associative memory\u201d (DAM) models, use an energy function with interaction functions of the form and, thereby, achieve a storage capacity proportional to (Krotov & Hopfield, 2016; 2018). The energy function of modern Hopfield networks makes them robust against adversarial attacks (Krotov & Hopfield, 2018). Modern binary Hopfield networks with energy functions based on interaction functions of the form even lead to storage capacity of , where all stored binary patterns are fixed points but the radius of attraction vanishes (Demircigil et\u00a0al., 2017). However, in order to integrate Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, it is necessary to make them differentiable, that is, we require continuous Hopfield networks (Hopfield, 1984; Koiran, 1994).\n\nTherefore, we generalize the energy function of Demircigil et\u00a0al. (2017) that builds on exponential interaction functions to continuous patterns and states and obtain a new modern Hopfield network. We also propose a new update rule which ensures global convergence to stationary points of the energy (local minima or saddle points). We prove that our new modern Hopfield network typically retrieves patterns in one update step (-close to the fixed point) with an exponentially low error and has a storage capacity proportional to (reasonable settings for and are given in Theorem\u00a03). The retrieval of patterns with one update is important to integrate Hopfield networks in deep learning architectures, where layers are activated only once. Surprisingly, our new update rule is also the key-value attention as used in transformer and BERT models (see Fig.\u00a01). Our modern Hopfield networks can be integrated as a new layer in deep learning architectures for pooling, memory, prototype learning, and attention. We test these new layers on different benchmark datasets and tasks like immune repertoire classification.\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: We generalize the energy of binary modern Hopfield networks to continuous states while keeping fast convergence and storage capacity properties. We also propose a new update rule that minimizes the energy. The new update rule is the attention mechanism of the transformer. Formulae are modified to express as row vector. \u201c\u201d-sign means \u201ckeeps the properties\u201d.   \n\n##  2 Modern Hopfield Nets with Continuous States\n\n##### New energy function for continuous state Hopfield networks.\n\nIn order to integrate modern Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, we have to make them continuous. To allow for continuous states, we propose a new energy function that is a modification of the energy of modern Hopfield networks (Demircigil et\u00a0al., 2017). We also propose a new update rule which can be proven to converge to stationary points of the energy (local minima or saddle points).\n\nWe have stored (key) patterns represented by the matrix with the largest pattern . The state (query) pattern is . For exponential interaction functions, we need the log-sum-exp function () for \n\n  (1)  \n\nwhich is convex (see appendix Eq.\u00a0(461), and Lemma\u00a0A22). The energy function of the modern Hopfield networks for binary patterns and a binary state pattern is (Krotov & Hopfield, 2016). Here, is the interaction function, where gives the classical Hopfield network. The storage capacity is proportional to (Krotov & Hopfield, 2016). This model was generalized by Demircigil et\u00a0al. (2017) to exponential interaction functions which gives the energy . This energy leads to an exponential storage capacity of for binary patterns. Furthermore, with a single update, the fixed point is recovered with high probability for random patterns. However, still this modern Hopfield network has binary states.\n\nWe generalize this energy function to continuous-valued patterns while keeping the properties of the modern Hopfield networks like the exponential storage capacity and the extremely fast convergence (see Fig.\u00a01). For the new energy we take the logarithm of the negative energy of modern Hopfield networks and add a quadratic term of the current state. The quadratic term ensures that the norm of the state vector remains finite and the energy is bounded. Classical Hopfield networks do not require to bound the norm of their state vector, since it is binary and has fixed length. We define the novel energy function as\n\n  (2)  \n\nWe have (see appendix Lemma\u00a0A1). Using , we define a novel update rule (see Fig.\u00a01):\n\n  (3)  \n\nThe next theorem states that the update rule Eq.\u00a0(3) converges globally. The proof uses the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) (Yuille & Rangarajan, 2002; 2003), which is equivalent to Legendre minimization (Rangarajan et\u00a0al., 1996; 1999) algorithms (Yuille & Rangarajan, 2003).\n\n######  Theorem 1.\n\nThe update rule Eq.\u00a0(3) converges globally: For , the energy for and a fixed point .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe update rule in Eq.\u00a0(3) is the CCCP for minimizing the energy , which is the sum of the convex and concave (see details in appendix Theorem\u00a01). Theorem\u00a02 in Yuille & Rangarajan (2002) yields the global convergence property. Also, in Theorem\u00a02 in Sriperumbudur & Lanckriet (2009) the global convergence of CCCP is proven via a rigorous analysis using Zangwill\u2019s global convergence theory of iterative algorithms. \u220e\n\nThe global convergence theorem only assures that for the energy for but not . The next theorem strengthens Zangwill\u2019s global convergence theorem (Meyer, 1976) and gives convergence results similar to those known for expectation maximization (Wu, 1983).\n\n######  Theorem 2.\n\nFor the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3) we have as , for some stationary point . Furthermore, and either converges or, in the other case, the set of limit points of is a connected and compact subset of , where and is the set of stationary points of the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3). If is finite, then any sequence generated by the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3) converges to some .\n\nFor a proof, see appendix Theorem\u00a02. Therefore, all the limit points of any sequence generated by the iteration Eq.\u00a0(3) are stationary points (local minima or saddle points) of the energy function . Either the iteration converges or, otherwise, the set of limit points is a connected and compact set.\n\nThe next theorem gives the results on the storage capacity of our new continuous state modern Hopfield network. We first define what we mean by storing and retrieving patterns using a modern Hopfield network with continuous states.\n\n######  Definition 1 (Pattern Stored and Retrieved).\n\nWe assume that around every pattern a sphere is given. We say is stored if there is a single fixed point to which all points converge, and for . We say is retrieved for a given if iteration (update rule) Eq.\u00a0(3) gives a point that is at least -close to the single fixed point . The retrieval error is .\n\nAs with classical Hopfield networks, we consider patterns on the sphere, i.e.\u00a0patterns with a fixed norm. For randomly chosen patterns, the number of patterns that can be stored is exponential in the dimension of the space of the patterns ().\n\n######  Theorem 3.\n\nWe assume a failure probability and randomly chosen patterns on the sphere with radius . We define , , and , where is the upper branch of the Lambert function (Olver et\u00a0al., 2010, (4.13)), and ensure . Then with probability , the number of random patterns that can be stored is\n\n  (4)  \n\nTherefore it is proven for with , , and () and proven for with , , , and ().\n\nFor a proof, see appendix Theorem\u00a0A5.\n\nThe next theorem states that the update rule typically retrieves patterns after one update. Retrieval of a pattern for fixed point and query is defined via an by , that is, the update is -close to the fixed point. Retrieval with one update is crucial to integrate modern Hopfield networks into deep learning architectures, where layers are activated only once. First we need the concept of separation of a pattern. For pattern we define its separation to other patterns by:\n\n  (5)  \n\nThe update rule retrieves patterns with one update for well separated patterns, that is, patterns with large .\n\n######  Theorem 4.\n\nWith query , after one update the distance of the new point to the fixed point is exponentially small in the separation . The precise bounds using the Jacobian and its value in the mean value theorem are:\n\n  (6)  \n(7)  \n\nFor given and sufficient large , we have , that is, retrieval with one update.\n\nSee proof in appendix Theorem\u00a0A8.\n\nAt the same time, the retrieval error decreases exponentially with the separation .\n\n######  Theorem 5 (Exponentially Small Retrieval Error).\n\nThe retrieval error of pattern is bounded by\n\n  (8)  \n\nand for together with by\n\n  (9)  \n\nSee proof in appendix Theorem\u00a0A9.\n\n##### Metastable states and one global fixed point.\n\nSo far, we considered patterns that are well separated and the iteration converges to a fixed point which is near a pattern . If no pattern is well separated from the others, then the iteration converges to a global fixed point close to the arithmetic mean of the vectors. In this case the vector is close to uniform, that is, . If some vectors are similar to each other and well separated from all other vectors, then a metastable state near the similar vectors exists. Iterations that start near the metastable state converge to this metastable state, also if initialized by one of the similar patterns. For convergence proofs to one global fixed point and to metastable states see appendix Lemma\u00a0A7 and Lemma\u00a0A12, respectively.\n\n##### Hopfield update rule is attention of the transformer.\n\nThe Hopfield network update rule is the attention mechanism used in transformer and BERT models (see Fig.\u00a01). To see this, we assume stored (key) patterns and state (query) patterns that are mapped to the Hopfield space of dimension . We set , , and multiply the result of our update rule with . The matrices and combine the and as row vectors. We define the matrices , , and , where . If and is changed to a row vector, we obtain for the update rule Eq.\u00a0(3) multiplied by :\n\n  (10)  \n\nThe left part of Eq.\u00a0(10) is the transformer attention. In the transformer self-attention , and replaced by just . Besides the attention mechanism, Hopfield networks allow for other functionalities in deep network architectures, which we introduce via specific layers in the next section. The right part of Eq.\u00a0(10) serves to explain these specific layers.\n\n##  3 New Hopfield Layers for Deep Learning\n\nModern Hopfield networks with continuous states can be integrated into deep learning architectures, because they are continuous and differentiable with respect to their parameters. Furthermore, they typically retrieve patterns with one update, which is conform to deep learning layers that are activated only once. For these two reasons, modern Hopfield networks can serve as specialized layers in deep networks to equip them with memories. Below, we introduce three types of Hopfield layers: Hopfield, HopfieldPooling, and HopfieldLayer. Possible applications of Hopfield layers in deep network architectures comprise:\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nmultiple instance learning (MIL) (Dietterich et\u00a0al., 1997),\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nprocessing of and learning with point sets (Qi et\u00a0al., 2017a; b; Xu et\u00a0al., 2018), \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nset-based and permutation invariant learning (Guttenberg et\u00a0al., 2016; Ravanbakhsh et\u00a0al., 2016; Zaheer et\u00a0al., 2017; Korshunova et\u00a0al., 2018; Ilse et\u00a0al., 2018; Zhai et\u00a0al., 2020),\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nattention-based learning (Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017a),\n\n  *  \u2022\n\ndeep learning with associative memories (Graves et\u00a0al., 2014; Weston et\u00a0al., 2014; Ba et\u00a0al., 2016a; b; Schlag & Schmidhuber, 2018; Schlag et\u00a0al., 2019),\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nnatural language processing (Devlin et\u00a0al., 2018; 2019),\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nsequence analysis and time series prediction (Hochreiter, 1991; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et\u00a0al., 2014), and\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nstoring and retrieving reference data, e.g.\u00a0the training data, outliers, high error data points, prototypes or cluster centers, support vectors & border cases.\n\nHopfield network layers can substitute existing layers like pooling layers, permutation equivariant layers (Guttenberg et\u00a0al., 2016; Ravanbakhsh et\u00a0al., 2016), GRU (Cho et\u00a0al., 2014) & LSTM (Hochreiter, 1991; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) layers, and attention layers (Vaswani et\u00a0al., 2017a; b; Bahdanau et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: Left: A standard deep network with layers ( ) propagates either a vector or a set of vectors from the input to the output. Right: A deep network, where layers ( ) are equipped with associative memories via Hopfield layers ( ).   \n\n##### Types of neural networks.\n\nWe consider two types of feed-forward neural networks: (I) Neural networks that propagate an activation vector from the input layer to the output layer. Examples are fully-connected or convolutional neural networks. (II) Neural networks that propagate a set of vectors from the input layer to the output layer, where each layer applies the same operation to each element of the set and the output layer may summarize the set via a vector. An example is the transformer. Recurrent neural networks are networks of type (I), which are iteratively applied to a set or a sequence, where intermediate results are stored in a memory and can be reused. Modern Hopfield networks can be integrated into both types of neural network architectures and enable to equip each of their layers with associative memories. See Fig.\u00a02.\n\n##### Types of new Hopfield layers.\n\nWe introduce three types of Hopfield layers: Hopfield, HopfieldPooling, and HopfieldLayer. The continuous modern Hopfield network results in a plethora of new deep learning architectures, since we can (a) propagate sets or single vectors, (b) propagate queries, stored patterns, or both, (c) learn static queries or stored patterns, (d) fill the memory by training sets, prototypes, or external data. Next, we provide three useful types of Hopfield layers. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/hopfield-layers\n\n(1) Layer Hopfield for networks that propagate sets of vectors via state (query) patterns and stored (key) patterns . The layer Hopfield is the realization of formula\u00a0(10). The memory of the Hopfield layer can be filled with sets from the input or previous layers, see Fig.\u00a03. The memory may be filled with a reference set, which is covered by providing the reference set as additional input. Thus, the layer Hopfield allows the association of two sets. A prominent example of a layer that performs such association is the transformer attention mechanism, which associates keys and queries, e.g.\u00a0two point sets that have to be compared. This layer allows for different kinds of sequence-to-sequence learning, point set operations, and retrieval-based methods. The layer Hopfield with skip connections in a ResNet architecture is identical to the popular transformer and BERT models. In the experiments, we analyzed these Hopfield layers in transformer architectures. In our experiments in which we compare machine learning methods on small datasets of the UCI benchmark collection the layer Hopfield is also used.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 3: The layer Hopfield allows the association of two sets ( ) and ( ). It can be integrated into deep networks that propagate sets of vectors. The Hopfield memory is filled with a set from either the input or previous layers. The output is a set of vectors ( ). \n\n(2) Layer HopfieldPooling for networks that propagate patterns via the stored (key) patterns . This layer performs a pooling or summarization of sets obtained from queries in previous layers or the input. The memory of the HopfieldPooling layer is filled with sets from the input or previous layers. The HopfieldPooling layer uses the queries to search for patterns in the memory, the stored set. If more patterns are similar to a particular search pattern (query), then the result is an average over these patterns. The state (query) patterns of each layer are static and can be learned. Multiple queries supply a set to the next layer, where each query corresponds to one element of the set. Thus, the layer HopfieldPooling enables fixed pattern search, pooling operations, and memories like LSTMs or GRUs. The static pattern functionality is typically needed if particular patterns must be identified in the data.   \nA single HopfieldPooling layer allows for multiple instance learning. Static state (query) patterns together with position encoding in the keys allows for performing pooling operations. The position encoding can be two-dimensional, where standard convolutional filters can be constructed as in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The HopfieldPooling layer can substitute pooling, averaging, LSTM, and permutation equivariant layers. See Fig.\u00a04. The layer HopfieldPooling is used for experiments with multiple instance learning tasks, e.g.\u00a0for immune repertoire classification in the experiments.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 4: The layer HopfieldPooling enables pooling or summarization of sets, which are obtained from the input or from previous layers. The input ( ) can be either a set or a sequence. The query patterns of each layer are static and can be learned. The output is a set of vectors ( ), where the number of vectors equals the number of query patterns. The layer HopfieldPooling can realize multiple instance learning. \n\n(3) Layer HopfieldLayer for networks that propagate a vector or a set of vectors via state (query) patterns . The queries can be input vectors or queries that are computed from the output of previous layers. The memory of the HopfieldLayer layer is filled with a fixed set, which can be the training set, a reference set, prototype set, or a learned set (a learned matrix). The stored (key) patterns are static and can be learned. If the training set is stored in the memory, then each layer constructs a new set of queries based on the query results of previous layers. The stored patterns can be initialized by the training set or a reference set and then learned, in which case they deviate from the training set. The stored patterns can be interpreted as weights from the state (query) to hidden neurons that have a softmax activation function (Krotov & Hopfield, 2020). The layer HopfieldLayer can substitute a fully connected layer, see Fig.\u00a05. A single HopfieldLayer layer also allows for approaches similar to support vector machines (SVMs), approaches similar to -nearest neighbor, approaches similar to learning vector quantization, and pattern search. For classification, the raw data can be the concatenation of input and target . In this case, the matrices and can be designed such that inside the softmax the input is used and outside the softmax the target . Thus, the softmax provides a weighted average of the target vectors based on the similarity between the query and the inputs. Also SVM models, -nearest neighbor, and learning vector quantization can be considered as weighted averages of the targets. The encoder-decoder attention layer of the transformers are a HopfieldL\nVisible: 0% - 11%", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "open_url", "args": ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02217.pdf"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "1beda71e-154b-47f5-ae83-15e0f8dc9e76", "request_id": "8512537d3b8b00ce-CDG", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "1beda71e-154b-47f5-ae83-15e0f8dc9e76", "children": ["7bf74d81-b736-4ae1-9bb4-9d9a9e080137"]}, "7bf74d81-b736-4ae1-9bb4-9d9a9e080137": {"id": "7bf74d81-b736-4ae1-9bb4-9d9a9e080137", "message": {"id": "7bf74d81-b736-4ae1-9bb4-9d9a9e080137", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1707211339.85677, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["- [Hopfield Networks is All You Need (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02217.pdf)\n\nThe paper \"Hopfield Networks is All You Need\" introduces a modernized Hopfield network with continuous states and an update rule that enables exponential storage of patterns and their efficient retrieval with minimal errors.

Accordingly we introduce a novel task\nL58: that consists in performing anytime Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging\nL59: from continuous speech. This HTR architecture is designed to\nL60: address three sub-tasks (phone word and POS tag estimation)\nL61: with increasing levels of abstraction. These tasks are performed\nL62: by the consecutive layers of the HTR architecture. Interestingly\nL63: the qualitative results show that the learning of sub-tasks en-\nL64: forces low frequency dynamics (i.e. with longer timescales) in\nL65: the more abstract layers. We compared HTR with a baseline\nL66: hierarchical reservoir architecture (in which each layer is an\nL67: ESN that addresses the same POS tag estimation).  Moreover\nL68: we also performed a thorough experimental comparison with\nL69: several architectural variants. Finally the HTR obtained the\nL70: best performance in all experimental comparisons. Overall the\nL71: proposed approach will be a useful tool for further studies\nL72: regarding both the modeling of language comprehension in\nL73: a neuroscience context and for real-time implementations in\nL74: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) context.\nL75: Index Terms\u2014Recurrent Neural Networks Hierarchical Reser-\nL76: voir Computing Natural Language Processing Speech Recogni-\nL77: tion Part-of-Speech POS tagging Anytime Process Hierarchical\nL78: Processing. \nL79: \nL80: \nL81: I. INTRODUCTION\nL82: \nL83: \nL84: Language unfolds in time. Both the brains of the speaker\nL85: and the hearer need to produce/process complex acoustic\nL86: streams. We easily forget the complexity at hand when we\nL87: speak our native language. However when one hears an\nL88: unknown foreign language little or no information could be\nL89: extracted from the acoustic stream. Another crucial property\nL90: of spoken language is the short availability of the signal\nL91: (compared to written text): the brain needs to process it as\nL92: quickly as possible because the phonological memory buffer\nL93: is very limited [1].\nL94: Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools (e.g. CoreNLP\nL95: NLTK Gensim and SpaCy) are quite different from how our\nL96: brains work. One example is the typical use of bag-of-words\nL97: (i.e. considering a sentence as unordered words instead of\nL98: considering the timing of the sequence of words). Most of the\nL99: recent NLP tools based on deep learning approaches [2]\u2013[4]\nL100: are focused on encoder/decoder mechanisms and bidirectional \nL101: \nL102: \nL103: architectures to address temporal and more complex depen-\nL104: dencies between words. However these implementations need\nL105: to parse the whole sentence before producing an output. On\nL106: the contrary brains process sentences online in an anytime\nL107: fashion (i.e. ability to have a partial understanding before the\nL108: end of the sentence).\nL109: For instance in the case of human-robot interaction through\nL110: spoken language [5]\u2013[7] a common approach is still to per-\nL111: form parsing of sentences based on a restricted grammar parser\nL112: written by hand with speech preprocessing done with Google\nL113: Speech API. It seems that even with Deep Learning based ar-\nL114: chitecture that try to integrate NLP and vision processing there\nL115: is still the need for ad-hoc word correction from the speech\nL116: API [8]. Overall these steps are performed by different mod-\nL117: ules instead of being a fully integrated architecture. Typically\nL118: the speech recognition module is implemented through a deep\nL119: learning approach based on sequence transduction approaches\nL120: [9]\u2013[11]. In these approaches there are two main limitations:\nL121: 1) one need to know in advance the maximal length of the\nL122: sentences in the test phase and 2) the speech module needs\nL123: to read the whole sentence in order to produce the phone\nL124: recognition of the input signal. Therefore these approaches\nL125: are not suitable for a real-time human-robot interaction system\nL126: or for biologically plausible cognitive models.\nL127: Since another important characteristic of the brain is the\nL128: presence of hierarchical structures the deep learning (DL)\nL129: paradigm took inspiration from this fact: for example for\nL130: the vision areas hierarchy (cortical areas V1 V2 V3 V4\nL131: etc.).  However this is only a shallow inspiration because\nL132: the brain is processing information in a much more dynamic\nL133: way: exempli\ufb01ed for instance by the presence of feedforward\nL134: and feedback connections [12] (e.g. there are strong feedback\nL135: connections from area V4 to area V2).  In particular deep\nL136: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [13]\u2013[15] are a class\nL137: of neural networks suitable for time series processing able\nL138: to intrinsically develop hierarchical and distributed temporal\nL139: features [16] [17]. However from the learning mechanisms\nL140: point of view the use of back-propagation in deep neural\nL141: networks makes these approaches not biologically plausible.\nL142: A good solution based on RNNs that avoids the use of back\nL143: \nL144: propagation is the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm [18]\nL145: [19]. Indeed RC is widely used to model brain processes with\nL146: RC instances such as Echo State Networks (ESNs) and Liquid\nL147: State Machines [19]. In this case we focus on the ESN model\nL148: that represents a discrete-time system.\nL149: More recent works introduce hierarchically organized mod-\nL150: els [9] [20] and deep recurrent architectures [16] [17] in the\nL151: context of RC. In particular Hierarchical Reservoir Computing\nL152: (HRC) obtained results competitive with the state-of-the-art on\nL153: continuous speech recognition [9].\nL154: Following these aspects the aim of this paper is to in-\nL155: troduce a novel model called Hierarchical-Task Reservoir\nL156: (HTR) for anytime sentence parsing from continuous speech\nL157: which combines the following aspects: i) suitable for real-time\nL158: implementations of sentence parsing from continuous speech\nL159: ii) learning different levels of abstraction through a hierarchy\nL160: of sub-tasks iii) ability to learn a hierarchical representation of\nL161: temporal features iv) a suitable tool for neuroscience linguistic\nL162: studies.\nL163: Based on such considerations we construct a novel sentence\nL164: parsing dataset for Anytime POS tagging basing on the TIMIT\nL165: continuous speech recognition corpus [21]. TIMIT is one of\nL166: the most used dataset for studies and analyses on continuous\nL167: speech recognition in the context of neural networks [9]\nL168: [10]. With the SpaCy library we computed the POS labels\nL169: starting from the sentences of the corpus. We quantitatively\nL170: and qualitatively compare HTR and HRC architectures on the\nL171: Anytime POS task. Then we qualitatively study the dynamics\nL172: developed in the layers of the HTR architecture. Finally\nL173: we quantitatively compare architectural variants of HTR to\nL174: empirically study the effect of the hierarchy of sub-tasks on\nL175: the model performance.\nL176: \nL177: \nL178: II. RESERVOIR COMPUTING\nL179: \nL180: \nL181: Reservoir Computing (RC) [22] is a paradigm for the design\nL182: and training of Recurrent Neural Networks in which the\nL183: recurrent layer is non-linear randomly initialized and left\nL184: untrained. Within RC networks in this work we are focused\nL185: on Leaky Integrator Echo State Networks (LI-ESNs) [23]. As\nL186: shown in Figure 1 the architecture of LI-ESN is composed by\nL187: a non-linear recurrent layer called the reservoir and a linear\nL188: output layer called readout. Omitting the bias in the following\nL189: \nL190: \nL191: Fig. 1. An example of Echo State Network architecture. \nL192: \nL193: \nL194: formulas for the ease of notation the state transition function\nL195: of the LI-ESN is computed as follows:\nL196: \nL197: \nL198: x(t) = (1 \u2212 a)x(t \u2212 1) + a tanh(Win \nL199: u(t) + Wx(t \u2212 1)) (1)\nL200: \nL201: \nL202: where u(t) \u2208 R\nL203: NU is the input at time t  x(t) \u2208 R\nL204: NR\nL205: \nL206: \nL207: is the reservoir state Win \nL208: \u2208 R\nL209: NR\nL210: \u00d7NU is the input matrix\nL211: W \u2208 R\nL212: NR\nL213: \u00d7NR is the recurrent matrix a \u2208 [0 1] is the leaky\nL214: parameter and tanh is the element-wise hyperbolic tangent.\nL215: The reservoir is initialized considering the echo state property\nL216: [24].  Accordingly the values of matrix W are randomly\nL217: initialized from a uniform distribution and then rescaled in\nL218: order to have a spectral radius \u03c1 (i.e. the maximum absolute\nL219: eigenvalue of W) less than 1. However in practical cases the\nL220: ESP can be satis\ufb01ed also with values of \u03c1 \u2265 1 [25]. The\nL221: values in matrix Win \nL222: are randomly initialized from a uniform\nL223: distribution and then rescaled in order to have a norm \u03c3. The\nL224: output of LI-ESN is computed as follows:\nL225: \nL226: \nL227: y(t) = Wout \nL228: x(t)  (2)\nL229: \nL230: \nL231: where y(t) \u2208 R\nL232: NY is the output at time t and Wout \nL233: is\nL234: the output matrix. The values in Wout \nL235: represent the free-\nL236: parameters of the model which are trained to solve the task\nL237: by computing typical approaches for linear optimization such\nL238: as ridge regression. In the following we use the term ESN to\nL239: refer to LI-ESN model.\nL240: Hierarchical Reservoir Computing (HRC) [9] is a RC ap-\nL241: proach that obtained promising results in Acoustic Modeling.\nL242: HRC networks are composed by a cascade of ESNs in which\nL243: each network is individually trained on the basis of the output\nL244: of the previous ESN. In this way the higher models can correct\nL245: the errors produced by the previous models. As shown by\nL246: recent studies regarding Deep Reservoir Computing [16] [17]\nL247: a main advantage offered by the layering in recurrent archi-\nL248: tectures is the ability to develop a hierarchical organization of\nL249: temporal features independently by the learning algorithm.\nL250: \nL251: \nL252: III. HIERARCHICAL-TASK RESERVOIR\nL253: \nL254: \nL255: The source code of the experiments is available\nL256: on our Github repository: https://github.com/lucapedrelli/\nL257: PedrelliHinaut2020 IJCNN\nL258: In this paper we introduce a novel architecture based on\nL259: HRC that we call Hierarchical-Task Reservoir (HTR).  The\nL260: architecture is composed by a hierarchy of layers in which\nL261: each layer is an ESN optimized on a different task. Each ESN\nL262: is fed by the previous ESN in the hierarchy and the pipeline\nL263: is progressively optimized from the \ufb01rst layer to the last layer.\nL264: The main differences between HTR and the approach proposed\nL265: in [9] are two: (i) instead of addressing only phone recognition\nL266: tasks HTR architectures deal with a different kind of task for\nL267: each layer with a progressively increased level of abstraction\nL268: (corresponding to a decreased frequency of labels). In this\nL269: way the learning process in\ufb02uences progressively the level of\nL270: abstraction of the representation in higher layers; (ii) instead\nL271: of controlling by hand the internal dynamics of the higher\nL272: layers with \ufb01xed input scales and \ufb01xed leaky integrators in\nL273: HTR we optimize all the hyper-parameters in each layer.

The output of layer l is computed as follows:\nL341: \nL342: \nL343: y(l)(t) = W(\nL344: out\nL345: l) \nL346: x(l)(t)  (5)\nL347: \nL348: \nL349: where x(l)(t) \u2208 R\nL350: NR is the reservoir state of layer l W(\nL351: in\nL352: l) \u2208\nL353: R\nL354: NR\nL355: \u00d7N\nL356: U\nL357: (l) \nL358: is the input matrix of layer l with a input dimension\nL359: of N\nL360: U\nL361: (l)\nL362:  W(l) \u2208 R\nL363: NR\nL364: \u00d7NR is the recurrent matrix of layer l\nL365: W\nL366: out\nL367: (l) \nL368: is the output matrix a(l) \u2208 [0 1] is the leaky parameter\nL369: and f(l) is the activation function of layer l.

The values of matrices W(\nL371: in\nL372: l)\nL373: \nL374: \nL375: and W(l) are randomly initialized from uniform distribution\nL376: and then rescaled such that the euclidean norm of W(\nL377: in\nL378: l) \nL379: is\nL380: equal to \u03c3(l) and the spectral radius of W(l) is equal to \u03c1(l). It\nL381: deserves to be mentioned that the values \u03c1(l) and a(l) have an\nL382: important role in controlling stability of deep recurrent neural\nL383: networks [26].\nL384: In HTR architecture each ESN is individually optimized\nL385: on a different task by performing random search (for hyper-\nL386: parameter tuning) and ridge regression (for readout learning)\nL387: following the pipeline from the layer 1 to the layer NL\nL388: . The\nL389: main architecture that we consider is composed by 3 layers:\nL390: (i) the \ufb01rst layer is optimized to estimate phones from speech\nL391: SP\u2192PH (ii) the second layer is optimized to estimate words\nL392: from phones PH\u2192WD and (iii) the third layer is optimized\nL393: to estimate POS tagging from words WD\u2192POS. Overall we\nL394: denote the whole HTR architecture as SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS.\nL395: The Algorithm 1 describes the optimization procedure for\nL396: HTR considering NL \nL397: layers NT rials \nL398: trials and external input\nL399: i(1) . In the following section we provide the description of the\nL400: considered tasks.\nL401: \nL402: \nL403: IV. ANYTIME POS TAGGING FROM SPEECH RECOGNITION\nL404: \nL405: \nL406: In this section we introduce a novel grammatical analysis\nL407: task for anytime part-of-speech (POS) tagging from continu-\nL408: ous speech recognition. It consists in a supervised classi\ufb01ca-\nL409: tion task in which the aim is to continuously provide the POS\nL410: Tagging estimation for each 10 ms frame of speech signal. \nL411: \nL412: \nL413: Fig. 2. HTR architecture: the main model we propose to address\nL414: the hierarchical task SP\u2192PH\u2192WD \u2192POS. The architecture receive the\nL415: features extracted from the speech signal with MFCC algorithm each 10 ms.\nL416: The \ufb01rst layer is optimized for SP\u2192PH (Task 1) the second layer is optimized\nL417: for PH\u2192WD (Task 2) and \ufb01nally the third layer is optimized for WD\u2192POS\nL418: (Task 3).\nL419: \nL420: \nL421: Accordingly the approaches evaluated on this task must be\nL422: suitable for real-time implementations.\nL423: For this purposes we focus on the TIMIT [21] corpus which\nL424: is widely used in the \ufb01eld of continuous speech recognition.\nL425: The dataset contains recordings from 630 American speakers\nL426: and each speaker read 10 phonetically rich sentences. Each\nL427: frame of 10 ms is labelled with a phone and a word class with\nL428: a total of 61 phones and 6012 words. We divided the dataset in\nL429: a training set containing 540 speaker and a test set containing\nL430: 90 speaker. We use the last 135 speaker for the validation set.\nL431: \nL432: As in [9] we reduce the number of phones from 61 to 51\nL433: merging similar sounds. In order to keep ef\ufb01ciency in training\nL434: processes we considered only the 50 most frequent words of\nL435: the corpus each having one output label and merging the\nL436: others in a single out-of-vocabolary (OOV) label.\nL437: We extended the dataset by computing the POS tagging\nL438: by using SpaCy tools for each sentence with a total of 17\nL439: grammatical elements. The POS labelling is performed by\nL440: computing a POS tag for each word. Then the POS tag is\nL441: associated with a class label for each frame that belongs to the\nL442: duration of the word in the speech signal. Finally a silence\nL443: label is considered as an additional class in correspondence\nL444: with silence frames in the speech signal. For each 10ms the\nL445: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coef\ufb01cients (MFCC) [9] algorithm\nL446: computes the 39 components used as input for the architectures\nL447: (see [9] for the setup of MFCC).\nL448: In order to form the whole hierarchical task for POS tagging\nL449: and to de\ufb01ne the different architectures for the experiments\nL450: we consider 10 sub-tasks listed in the following: SP\u2192PH\nL451: (predict phones from speech) PH\u2192WD (words from phones)\nL452: WD\u2192POS (POS from words) SP\u2192WD (words from speech)\nL453: SP\u2192POS (POS from speech) PH\u2192POS (POS from phones)\nL454: WD\u2192POS (POS from words)  WD(lb)\u2192POS (POS from\nL455: words labels) PH(lb)\u2192WD (words from phones labels) and\nL456: PH(lb)\u2192POS (POS from phones labels).  In all tasks the\nL457: evaluation is performed by computing the frame error rate\nL458: (FER) which is the ratio between the number of correctly\nL459: classi\ufb01ed time steps and the total number of time steps.\nL460: For each task the model selection is performed with a\nL461: random search evaluating the performance on the validation\nL462: set. For each trial we sample the hyper-parameters spectral\nL463: radius in the following way: \u03c1(l) and input norm \u03c3(l) from a\nL464: logarithmic distribution in [0.1 10] leak-rate a(l) from a uni-\nL465: form distribution in [0.1 1] and ridge (regularisation) \u03bb(l) from\nL466: a discrete uniform distribution in [100 10\u22121 ... 10\u22127 10\u22128].\nL467: In training phase a search grid is performed on \u03bb(l) consid-\nL468: ering values reported above. As in standard RC each hyper-\nL469: parametrization (i.e. \u03c1(l) \u03c3(l) a(l) and \u03bb(l)) is evaluated aver-\nL470: aging the results obtained by randomly initialized architectures\nL471: (that we call guesses). In this work we consider 5 guesses.\nL472: In order to keep the execution of the hyper-parameter search\nL473: in a reasonable time we did not optimize the input scaling of\nL474: each MFCC input component individually. Triefenbach et al.\nL475: [9] optimized inputs scaling by clusters: optimizing the scaling\nL476: for signals signal derivative (delta) and signal acceleration\nL477: (i.e. delta-delta). Moreover since we have several experiments\nL478: to perform (due to a thorough architectural comparison) on a\nL479: signi\ufb01cantly big corpus we performed preliminary experiments\nL480: to \ufb01x a proper number of units. We \ufb01nd that 1000 units are\nL481: a good tradeoff between accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency considering\nL482: also that the proposed approach must be ef\ufb01ciently executable\nL483: in real-time. Accordingly in the following all experiments are\nL484: performed by using NR \nL485: = 1000 for each ESN layer.\nL486: The 3 main architectures that we consider in this paper are\nL487: listed in Table I. Therefore in HTR \ufb01rst the layer ESN 1 (see\nL488: Figure 2) is optimized to estimate phones (PH) from speech \nL489: \nL490: \nL491: TABLE I\nL492: THE TASK STRUCTURE OF THE ARCHITECTURES HTR HRC AND ESN.\nL493: \nL494: \nL495: Name\nL496: HTR\nL497: HRC\nL498: ESN \nL499: \nL500: \nL501: Architecture\nL502: SP\u2192PH \u2192WD\u2192POS\nL503: SP\u2192POS\u2192POS\u2192POS\nL504: SP\u2192POS\nL505: \nL506: \nL507: (SP) then ESN 2 is optimized to recognize words (WD) from\nL508: phones and \ufb01nally ESN 3 is optimized to estimate POS tagging\nL509: from words. Differently in HRC case ESN 1 is optimized to\nL510: estimate POS from HRC while ESN 2 and ESN 3 are both\nL511: optimized to estimate POS tagging from POS tagging. The\nL512: ESN in I is optimize to estimate POS tagging from speech\nL513: implementing 3000 units (the same total number of units of\nL514: HTR and HRC).\nL515: \nL516: \nL517: V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nL518: \nL519: \nL520: A. Architecture Comparison on the Anytime POS Task\nL521: Here we present the results obtained by HTR HRC and\nL522: ESN on the Anytime POS Task. Table II shows the test FERs\nL523: achieved by HTR HRC and ESN. The HTR obtained the\nL524: best result with a test FER of 45.51% followed by HRC and\nL525: ESN that achieved 49.55% and 53.40% test FER respectively.\nL526: First we can note that HRC achieve 4.08 FER points less\nL527: \nL528: \nL529: TABLE II\nL530: TEST FERS: HTR HRC AND ESN ON THE ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL531: \nL532: \nL533: Architecture\nL534: HTR\nL535: HRC\nL536: ESN \nL537: \nL538: \nL539: Test\nL540: 45.51(0.04)%\nL541: 49.32(0.12)%\nL542: 53.40(0.15)%\nL543: \nL544: \nL545: than ESN. This highlights that solving the Anytime POS task\nL546: with a pipeline of ESN modules as performed in HRC allows\nL547: us to improve the results with respect to the use of a single\nL548: ESN module (containing a total equivalent number of reservoir\nL549: units). Moreover the hierarchical-task approach implemented\nL550: by HTR (i.e. considering progressively more abstract sub-tasks\nL551: in higher layers) allows us to have a further improvement on\nL552: the Anytime POS task outperforming HRC architecture by\nL553: 4.04 FER points.\nL554: \nL555: \nL556: B. Improving HRC Perf. by increasing the number of layers\nL557: In this section we show the experimental results obtained\nL558: by HRC on the Anytime POS Task by varying the number\nL559: of layers. Table III shows the test FERs achieved by HRC\nL560: considering progressively more layers in the architecture (i.e.\nL561: 1 2 and 3 layers). The HRC architecture obtained 50.35%\nL562: 49.55% and 49.32% test FER for 1 2 and 3 layers re-\nL563: spectively. We can note that the error obtained by the HRC\nL564: architecture decreases when the number of layers increases.\nL565: This con\ufb01rms the ability of the next layers to correct the errors\nL566: made by the previous layers as achieved in [9]. This aspect\nL567: is also interesting in relation to results obtained by the ESN\nL568: with 3000 units (see Table II). This suggests that in terms of\nL569: \nL570: TABLE III\nL571: TEST FERS OBTAINED ON THE ANYTIME POS TASK BY PROGRESSIVELY\nL572: ADDING LAYERS IN THE HRC ARCHITECTURE.\nL573: \nL574: \nL575: HRC\nL576: SP\u2192POS\nL577: SP\u2192POS\u2192POS\nL578: SP\u2192POS\u2192POS\u2192POS \nL579: \nL580: \nL581: FER\nL582: 50.35(0.19)%\nL583: 49.55(0.14)%\nL584: 49.32(0.12)%\nL585: \nL586: \nL587: performance on the considered task a hierarchical pipeline of\nL588: ESN moules is much more effective than a big single ESN.\nL589: \nL590: \nL591: C.

Qualitative Comparison Between HTR and HRC\nL764: In this section we show a qualitative comparison between\nL765: HTR and HRC of the Anytime POS estimation when the \nL766: \nL767: \nL768: In Figures 4b c and d each line represents the value of\nL769: an output neuron over the time each neuron is associated to\nL770: a POS class and the output of the model at each time step\nL771: is the POS class associated to the neuron with the maximum\nL772: value. The estimated POS tags are shown in Figures 4 above\nL773: the output values. From Figure 4b we can see that in many\nL774: areas the estimation is not precise since some output units\nL775: have overlapped ranges. For instance after the estimation of\nL776: silence (label #h) in the \ufb01rsts time steps the model suffers\nL777: from uncertainty with a consequent decrease of accuracy for\nL778: those predictions. Interestingly from Figure 4c we can see\nL779: that considering one more layer in the HTR architecture the\nL780: estimation is signi\ufb01cantly improved since the predictions are\nL781: more clearly separated.

Qualitative Analysis of HRT\nL1049: \nL1050: \nL1051: In this section we present the qualitative analysis performed\nL1052: on the HTR architecture with 3 layers (SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS).\nL1053: Figures 6b c and d show the predictions of the layer 1 2\nL1054: and 3 relative to the phone words and POS classi\ufb01cations\nL1055: respectively. As we expected since tasks are different and\nL1056: progressively more abstract we can see from Figures 6b and\nL1057: 6c that the layers values goes from an higher to a lower\nL1058: frequency of prediction. This means that the readouts trained\nL1059: on different kinds of tasks with different label frequencies\nL1060: force progressively the dynamic of the layers from high to\nL1061: low frequencies.\nL1062: In Figures 6c and d at the dashed vertical lines we can see\nL1063: an interesting example in which the model is able to estimate\nL1064: the correct POS even if the word is OOV (i.e. label class for \nL1065: \nL1066: \nL1067: 0.5\nL1068: \nL1069: \nL1070: 0\nL1071: \nL1072: \nL1073: 0  50  100\nL1074: Time steps150  200  250\nL1075: \nL1076: \nL1077: Fig. 6.

This highlights that\nL1089: although the last layer is fed without the direct information\nL1090: of the previous word the carried information is rich enough\nL1091: to perform a correct classi\ufb01cation.

Architectural Variants of HRT\nL1098: \nL1099: \nL1100: In this section we present the results of other architec-\nL1101: tural variants of HTR. First we compare SP\u2192PH\u2192POS\nL1102: with SP\u2192WD\u2192POS in order to evaluate a variant of HTR\nL1103: without the phone recognition task. Table V shows the test\nL1104: errors obtained by the two considered architectural vari-\nL1105: ants. Interestingly SP\u2192WD\u2192POS is outperformed by both\nL1106: SP\u2192PH\u2192POS and SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS (see Table IV). This\nL1107: highlights that it is important to address the task SP\u2192PH for\nL1108: layer 1 instead of addressing directly the task SP\u2192WD.\nL1109: Moreover the results presented in Table IV suggest that\nL1110: the 3rd layer (related to the task WD\u2192POS) plays a relevant\nL1111: role in the achievement of the global task. Indeed the error\nL1112: decreased from 47.62% to 45.51% FER. This highlights the\nL1113: \nL1114: TABLE V\nL1115: TEST FERS ACHIEVED BY ARCHITECTURES SP\u2192PH\u2192POS AND\nL1116: SP\u2192WD\u2192POS ON THE ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL1117: \nL1118: \nL1119: Architectures\nL1120: SP\u2192PH\u2192POS\nL1121: SP\u2192WD\u2192POS \nL1122: \nL1123: \nL1124: FER\nL1125: 47.62(0.12)%\nL1126: 48.52(0.32)% \nL1127: \nL1128: \nL1129: TABLE VII\nL1130: TEST FERS ACHIEVED BY WD(LB)\u2192POS PH(LB)\u2192WD\u2192POS AND\nL1131: PH(LB)\u2192POS ARCHITECTURES ON ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL1132: \nL1133: \nL1134: Architectures\nL1135: WD(lb)\u2192POS\nL1136: PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS\nL1137: PH(lb)\u2192POS \nL1138: \nL1139: \nL1140: FER\nL1141: 30.03(0.36)%\nL1142: 41.40(0.13)%\nL1143: 41.81(0.31)%\nL1144: \nL1145: \nL1146: importance of the 3rd layer in the correction of errors made\nL1147: by the previous layer. Then the obtained results highlight\nL1148: that SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS is the best choice to improve the\nL1149: performance on the Anytime POS task.\nL1150: However the use of only 50 words out of 6012 for the\nL1151: WD\u2192POS task could be a bottleneck for the richness of the\nL1152: information used to solve the POS task. Therefore a skip\nL1153: connection between layer 1 and layer 3 could carry more\nL1154: information and accordingly improve the results. The skip\nL1155: connection is obtained by concatenating the input of ESN 3\nL1156: with the output of ESN 1 (see Figure 2) we call this variant\nL1157: HTR-skip. Table VI shows the test errors achieved by HTR\nL1158: and HTR-skip. We can see from Table VI that HTR-skip and\nL1159: \nL1160: \nL1161: TABLE VI\nL1162: TEST FERS ACHIEVED BY HTR AND HTR-SKIP ON ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL1163: \nL1164: \nL1165: Architectures\nL1166: HTR\nL1167: HTR-skip \nL1168: \nL1169: \nL1170: FER\nL1171: 45.511(0.04)%\nL1172: 45.506(0.04)%\nL1173: \nL1174: \nL1175: HTR obtained very similar results. The lack of performance\nL1176: improvement and the qualitative analysis shown in Figure 6\nL1177: suggest that the ESN 2 (see Figure 2) can carry enough rich\nL1178: information even using only the estimation of the 50 words +\nL1179: OOV label.\nL1180: Overall the results obtained by HRC in Table III (i.e. with-\nL1181: out intermediate tasks) and the results obtained by architectural\nL1182: variants in Table V (i.e. with only SP\u2192PH or SP\u2192WD\nL1183: intermediate task) suggest that using several intermediate tasks\nL1184: is crucial to obtain the best performance.\nL1185: \nL1186: \nL1187: G. Ground Truth Architectures\nL1188: Here we present the results obtained by architectural vari-\nL1189: ants which address the Anytime POS task starting from the\nL1190: ground truth of phones or words instead of starting from the\nL1191: speech signal. In this way these architectures represent the\nL1192: performance that the model can reach on the Anytime POS\nL1193: task with the help of a perfect phone recognition system (i.e.\nL1194: PH(lb)) or a perfect word recognition system (i.e. WD(lb)).\nL1195: Table VII shows the test FERs obtained by WD(lb)\u2192POS\nL1196: PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS and PH(lb)\u2192POS where WD(lb) and\nL1197: PH(lb) are the ground truth of words and phones respectively.\nL1198: As expected WD(lb)\u2192POS obtained the best performance\nL1199: with a FER of 30.03% followed by PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS with\nL1200: 41.40% FER and PH(lb)\u2192POS with 41.81% FER.\nL1201: \nL1202: \nL1203: H. Comparing Results\nL1204: Comparing results from TableVII and Table IV it seems\nL1205: counter-intuitive that adding the WD task in-between the \nL1206: \nL1207: \nL1208: PH\u2192POS \ufb02ow improves performance mostly when starting\nL1209: from the speech signal (from 47.62% to 45.51%) and not\nL1210: when starting from the ground truth phones (from 41.81% to\nL1211: 41.81%). Therefore it suggests that the WD task is actually\nL1212: used to correct errors made at the phone-level (ESN 1) in\nL1213: the full HTR architecture (i.e. SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS). This is\nL1214: another aspect that con\ufb01rms the usefulness of our Hierarchical-\nL1215: Task approach since multiple tasks with an increasing level\nL1216: of abstraction enable the correction of previous errors.\nL1217: Moreover we can say that the performance achieved by\nL1218: WD(lb)\u2192POS architecture (30.03% FER) shows that ob-\nL1219: taining POS labels starting from phones (PH) signi\ufb01cantly\nL1220: increases the dif\ufb01culty of the task compared to starting from\nL1221: words (WD).  Therefore this suggests that using the WD\nL1222: task in the full HTR architecture is crucial to have better\nL1223: performances on POS tagging.\nL1224: Finally it is worth mentioning that the baseline performance\nL1225: that we could expect to reach with the full HTR architecture\nL1226: (41.40% FER with PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS) starting from the\nL1227: speech signal is not so far away from the 45.51% obtained\nL1228: starting from a perfect phone recognition system PH(lb).\nL1229: \nL1230: \nL1231: VI. DISCUSSION\nL1232: \nL1233: \nL1234: In this work with the HTR architecture we introduced\nL1235: a novel tool suitable for real-time sentence parsing [27] of\nL1236: continuous speech. For this purpose we introduced a novel\nL1237: task for the Anytime POS tagging from continuous speech\nL1238: extending the TIMIT corpus. The HTR is composed by a\nL1239: hierarchy of ESNs in which each ESN is optimized on a\nL1240: different task (i.e. phone word POS tag recognition). The\nL1241: level of abstraction of the task increases when the layer\u2019s level\nL1242: increases.\nL1243: The qualitative experiments performed on the output values\nL1244: of the layers highlight that the learning of sub-tasks with\nL1245: a progressively decreasing temporal frequency of labels for\nL1246: higher layers force a progressively low temporal frequency\nL1247: dynamic according to the depth of the architecture. This ability\nL1248: can help the HTR to progressively develop a proper level\nL1249: of abstraction of the input signal in order to improve the\nL1250: performance of the whole task.\nL1251: Moreover we quantitatively compared HTR with a typical\nL1252: hierarchical reservoir architecture that implements the estima-\nL1253: tion of POS tags in each layer. Then we also compare the HTR\nL1254: with several architectural variants. The quantitative results\nL1255: show that the whole hierarchy of sub-tasks implemented in\nL1256: HTR is crucial to signi\ufb01cantly improve the performance.\nL1257: Finally HTR obtain only about 4 points of FER less than the\nL1258: \nL1259: architecture trained starting from the outputs of a perfect phone\nL1260: recognition system (PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS). We can conclude\nL1261: that HTR is competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches\nL1262: in the RC \ufb01eld on the Anytime POS task.\nL1263: Overall the HTR model and the Anytime POS task intro-\nL1264: duced in this paper are interesting tools for further studies\nL1265: regarding the language comprehension in neuroscience ap-\nL1266: proaches [28] [29] or for the implementation of a real-time\nL1267: human-robot interaction (HRI) [5]\u2013[7] [30].\nL1268: In future work it would be interesting to get inspiration\nL1269: from neurobiological \ufb01ndings on brain hierarchy: in primate\nL1270: brains there are feedforward and feedback connections be-\nL1271: tween brain areas of different abstraction levels [12]. Indeed\nL1272: information does not only go from sensory (i.e. less abstract)\nL1273: to more integrated areas (i.e. more abstract)  it also \ufb02ows\nL1274: from more abstract to less abstract areas. Thus hierarchical\nL1275: models could be designed to incorporate these bottom-up\nL1276: processing (i.e. from sensory to more abstract representations)\nL1277: and top-down processing (i.e. from abstract to more sensory\nL1278: representations).  In order to apply this idea to the current\nL1279: HTR model composed of feedforward reservoirs we could\nL1280: add backwards reservoirs (i.e. feedback reservoirs)1.  These\nL1281: backwards reservoirs would be trained to predict a less abstract\nL1282: task (of the layer n \u2212 1) given a more abstract task (of the\nL1283: layer n).  This would enable these backwards reservoirs to\nL1284: predict and update low-level representations based on more\nL1285: high-level representations. Most importantly this could enable\nL1286: to not only predict but also to postdict [31] low-level outputs:\nL1287: this corresponds to predict the past given current information\nL1288: i.e. update previous beliefs or perceptions. The integration\nL1289: of both prediction and postdiction in an architecture reminds\nL1290: the ability of bi-LSTMs to use both past and future input\nL1291: features [32]. Consequently the output representations may\nL1292: need to be updated in order to use a kind of a-temporal\nL1293: representation of readouts: i.e. representing outputs for t \u2212 n\nL1294: t and t + n for any time step n instead of just representing\nL1295: the current output at time step t.\nL1296: The proposed HTR architecture is a promising \ufb01rst step\nL1297: towards general hierarchical modeling of language compre-\nL1298: hension and production starting from speech signal. Further\nL1299: works in this line of research could focus on the addition\nL1300: of more abstract layers to perform tasks such as sentence\nL1301: chunking/segmentation Name Entity Recognition Sentiment\nL1302: Analysis or Semantic-Role Labelling [33]. Moreover because\nL1303: the long-term goal of this architecture is to model brain\nL1304: processes thus is not limited to speech or natural language\nL1305: processing but suf\ufb01ciently general to be applied to a variety\nL1306: of tasks such as gesture recognition or sensorimotor learning.\nL1307: \nL1308: \nL1309: REFERENCES\nL1310: \nL1311: \nL1312: [1] M.

Accordingly we introduce a novel task\nL58: that consists in performing anytime Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging\nL59: from continuous speech. This HTR architecture is designed to\nL60: address three sub-tasks (phone word and POS tag estimation)\nL61: with increasing levels of abstraction. These tasks are performed\nL62: by the consecutive layers of the HTR architecture. Interestingly\nL63: the qualitative results show that the learning of sub-tasks en-\nL64: forces low frequency dynamics (i.e. with longer timescales) in\nL65: the more abstract layers. We compared HTR with a baseline\nL66: hierarchical reservoir architecture (in which each layer is an\nL67: ESN that addresses the same POS tag estimation).  Moreover\nL68: we also performed a thorough experimental comparison with\nL69: several architectural variants. Finally the HTR obtained the\nL70: best performance in all experimental comparisons. Overall the\nL71: proposed approach will be a useful tool for further studies\nL72: regarding both the modeling of language comprehension in\nL73: a neuroscience context and for real-time implementations in\nL74: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) context.\nL75: Index Terms\u2014Recurrent Neural Networks Hierarchical Reser-\nL76: voir Computing Natural Language Processing Speech Recogni-\nL77: tion Part-of-Speech POS tagging Anytime Process Hierarchical\nL78: Processing. \nL79: \nL80: \nL81: I. INTRODUCTION\nL82: \nL83: \nL84: Language unfolds in time. Both the brains of the speaker\nL85: and the hearer need to produce/process complex acoustic\nL86: streams. We easily forget the complexity at hand when we\nL87: speak our native language. However when one hears an\nL88: unknown foreign language little or no information could be\nL89: extracted from the acoustic stream. Another crucial property\nL90: of spoken language is the short availability of the signal\nL91: (compared to written text): the brain needs to process it as\nL92: quickly as possible because the phonological memory buffer\nL93: is very limited [1].\nL94: Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools (e.g. CoreNLP\nL95: NLTK Gensim and SpaCy) are quite different from how our\nL96: brains work. One example is the typical use of bag-of-words\nL97: (i.e. considering a sentence as unordered words instead of\nL98: considering the timing of the sequence of words). Most of the\nL99: recent NLP tools based on deep learning approaches [2]\u2013[4]\nL100: are focused on encoder/decoder mechanisms and bidirectional \nL101: \nL102: \nL103: architectures to address temporal and more complex depen-\nL104: dencies between words. However these implementations need\nL105: to parse the whole sentence before producing an output. On\nL106: the contrary brains process sentences online in an anytime\nL107: fashion (i.e. ability to have a partial understanding before the\nL108: end of the sentence).\nL109: For instance in the case of human-robot interaction through\nL110: spoken language [5]\u2013[7] a common approach is still to per-\nL111: form parsing of sentences based on a restricted grammar parser\nL112: written by hand with speech preprocessing done with Google\nL113: Speech API. It seems that even with Deep Learning based ar-\nL114: chitecture that try to integrate NLP and vision processing there\nL115: is still the need for ad-hoc word correction from the speech\nL116: API [8]. Overall these steps are performed by different mod-\nL117: ules instead of being a fully integrated architecture. Typically\nL118: the speech recognition module is implemented through a deep\nL119: learning approach based on sequence transduction approaches\nL120: [9]\u2013[11]. In these approaches there are two main limitations:\nL121: 1) one need to know in advance the maximal length of the\nL122: sentences in the test phase and 2) the speech module needs\nL123: to read the whole sentence in order to produce the phone\nL124: recognition of the input signal. Therefore these approaches\nL125: are not suitable for a real-time human-robot interaction system\nL126: or for biologically plausible cognitive models.\nL127: Since another important characteristic of the brain is the\nL128: presence of hierarchical structures the deep learning (DL)\nL129: paradigm took inspiration from this fact: for example for\nL130: the vision areas hierarchy (cortical areas V1 V2 V3 V4\nL131: etc.).  However this is only a shallow inspiration because\nL132: the brain is processing information in a much more dynamic\nL133: way: exempli\ufb01ed for instance by the presence of feedforward\nL134: and feedback connections [12] (e.g. there are strong feedback\nL135: connections from area V4 to area V2).  In particular deep\nL136: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [13]\u2013[15] are a class\nL137: of neural networks suitable for time series processing able\nL138: to intrinsically develop hierarchical and distributed temporal\nL139: features [16] [17]. However from the learning mechanisms\nL140: point of view the use of back-propagation in deep neural\nL141: networks makes these approaches not biologically plausible.\nL142: A good solution based on RNNs that avoids the use of back\nL143: \nL144: propagation is the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm [18]\nL145: [19]. Indeed RC is widely used to model brain processes with\nL146: RC instances such as Echo State Networks (ESNs) and Liquid\nL147: State Machines [19]. In this case we focus on the ESN model\nL148: that represents a discrete-time system.\nL149: More recent works introduce hierarchically organized mod-\nL150: els [9] [20] and deep recurrent architectures [16] [17] in the\nL151: context of RC. In particular Hierarchical Reservoir Computing\nL152: (HRC) obtained results competitive with the state-of-the-art on\nL153: continuous speech recognition [9].\nL154: Following these aspects the aim of this paper is to in-\nL155: troduce a novel model called Hierarchical-Task Reservoir\nL156: (HTR) for anytime sentence parsing from continuous speech\nL157: which combines the following aspects: i) suitable for real-time\nL158: implementations of sentence parsing from continuous speech\nL159: ii) learning different levels of abstraction through a hierarchy\nL160: of sub-tasks iii) ability to learn a hierarchical representation of\nL161: temporal features iv) a suitable tool for neuroscience linguistic\nL162: studies.\nL163: Based on such considerations we construct a novel sentence\nL164: parsing dataset for Anytime POS tagging basing on the TIMIT\nL165: continuous speech recognition corpus [21]. TIMIT is one of\nL166: the most used dataset for studies and analyses on continuous\nL167: speech recognition in the context of neural networks [9]\nL168: [10]. With the SpaCy library we computed the POS labels\nL169: starting from the sentences of the corpus. We quantitatively\nL170: and qualitatively compare HTR and HRC architectures on the\nL171: Anytime POS task. Then we qualitatively study the dynamics\nL172: developed in the layers of the HTR architecture. Finally\nL173: we quantitatively compare architectural variants of HTR to\nL174: empirically study the effect of the hierarchy of sub-tasks on\nL175: the model performance.\nL176: \nL177: \nL178: II. RESERVOIR COMPUTING\nL179: \nL180: \nL181: Reservoir Computing (RC) [22] is a paradigm for the design\nL182: and training of Recurrent Neural Networks in which the\nL183: recurrent layer is non-linear randomly initialized and left\nL184: untrained. Within RC networks in this work we are focused\nL185: on Leaky Integrator Echo State Networks (LI-ESNs) [23]. As\nL186: shown in Figure 1 the architecture of LI-ESN is composed by\nL187: a non-linear recurrent layer called the reservoir and a linear\nL188: output layer called readout. Omitting the bias in the following\nL189: \nL190: \nL191: Fig. 1. An example of Echo State Network architecture. \nL192: \nL193: \nL194: formulas for the ease of notation the state transition function\nL195: of the LI-ESN is computed as follows:\nL196: \nL197: \nL198: x(t) = (1 \u2212 a)x(t \u2212 1) + a tanh(Win \nL199: u(t) + Wx(t \u2212 1)) (1)\nL200: \nL201: \nL202: where u(t) \u2208 R\nL203: NU is the input at time t  x(t) \u2208 R\nL204: NR\nL205: \nL206: \nL207: is the reservoir state Win \nL208: \u2208 R\nL209: NR\nL210: \u00d7NU is the input matrix\nL211: W \u2208 R\nL212: NR\nL213: \u00d7NR is the recurrent matrix a \u2208 [0 1] is the leaky\nL214: parameter and tanh is the element-wise hyperbolic tangent.\nL215: The reservoir is initialized considering the echo state property\nL216: [24].  Accordingly the values of matrix W are randomly\nL217: initialized from a uniform distribution and then rescaled in\nL218: order to have a spectral radius \u03c1 (i.e. the maximum absolute\nL219: eigenvalue of W) less than 1. However in practical cases the\nL220: ESP can be satis\ufb01ed also with values of \u03c1 \u2265 1 [25]. The\nL221: values in matrix Win \nL222: are randomly initialized from a uniform\nL223: distribution and then rescaled in order to have a norm \u03c3. The\nL224: output of LI-ESN is computed as follows:\nL225: \nL226: \nL227: y(t) = Wout \nL228: x(t)  (2)\nL229: \nL230: \nL231: where y(t) \u2208 R\nL232: NY is the output at time t and Wout \nL233: is\nL234: the output matrix. The values in Wout \nL235: represent the free-\nL236: parameters of the model which are trained to solve the task\nL237: by computing typical approaches for linear optimization such\nL238: as ridge regression. In the following we use the term ESN to\nL239: refer to LI-ESN model.\nL240: Hierarchical Reservoir Computing (HRC) [9] is a RC ap-\nL241: proach that obtained promising results in Acoustic Modeling.\nL242: HRC networks are composed by a cascade of ESNs in which\nL243: each network is individually trained on the basis of the output\nL244: of the previous ESN. In this way the higher models can correct\nL245: the errors produced by the previous models. As shown by\nL246: recent studies regarding Deep Reservoir Computing [16] [17]\nL247: a main advantage offered by the layering in recurrent archi-\nL248: tectures is the ability to develop a hierarchical organization of\nL249: temporal features independently by the learning algorithm.\nL250: \nL251: \nL252: III. HIERARCHICAL-TASK RESERVOIR\nL253: \nL254: \nL255: The source code of the experiments is available\nL256: on our Github repository: https://github.com/lucapedrelli/\nL257: PedrelliHinaut2020 IJCNN\nL258: In this paper we introduce a novel architecture based on\nL259: HRC that we call Hierarchical-Task Reservoir (HTR).  The\nL260: architecture is composed by a hierarchy of layers in which\nL261: each layer is an ESN optimized on a different task. Each ESN\nL262: is fed by the previous ESN in the hierarchy and the pipeline\nL263: is progressively optimized from the \ufb01rst layer to the last layer.\nL264: The main differences between HTR and the approach proposed\nL265: in [9] are two: (i) instead of addressing only phone recognition\nL266: tasks HTR architectures deal with a different kind of task for\nL267: each layer with a progressively increased level of abstraction\nL268: (corresponding to a decreased frequency of labels). In this\nL269: way the learning process in\ufb02uences progressively the level of\nL270: abstraction of the representation in higher layers; (ii) instead\nL271: of controlling by hand the internal dynamics of the higher\nL272: layers with \ufb01xed input scales and \ufb01xed leaky integrators in\nL273: HTR we optimize all the hyper-parameters in each layer. In\nL274: \nL275: this way the hyper-parameters are optimized depending on the\nL276: task addressed by the layer.\nL277: The Figure 2 shows an example of the maximal size HTR\nL278: architecture used in this paper. The state computation of the\nL279: HTR architecture for the layer l = 1 ...

The values of matrices W(\nL371: in\nL372: l)\nL373: \nL374: \nL375: and W(l) are randomly initialized from uniform distribution\nL376: and then rescaled such that the euclidean norm of W(\nL377: in\nL378: l) \nL379: is\nL380: equal to \u03c3(l) and the spectral radius of W(l) is equal to \u03c1(l). It\nL381: deserves to be mentioned that the values \u03c1(l) and a(l) have an\nL382: important role in controlling stability of deep recurrent neural\nL383: networks [26].\nL384: In HTR architecture each ESN is individually optimized\nL385: on a different task by performing random search (for hyper-\nL386: parameter tuning) and ridge regression (for readout learning)\nL387: following the pipeline from the layer 1 to the layer NL\nL388: . The\nL389: main architecture that we consider is composed by 3 layers:\nL390: (i) the \ufb01rst layer is optimized to estimate phones from speech\nL391: SP\u2192PH (ii) the second layer is optimized to estimate words\nL392: from phones PH\u2192WD and (iii) the third layer is optimized\nL393: to estimate POS tagging from words WD\u2192POS. Overall we\nL394: denote the whole HTR architecture as SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS.\nL395: The Algorithm 1 describes the optimization procedure for\nL396: HTR considering NL \nL397: layers NT rials \nL398: trials and external input\nL399: i(1) . In the following section we provide the description of the\nL400: considered tasks.\nL401: \nL402: \nL403: IV. ANYTIME POS TAGGING FROM SPEECH RECOGNITION\nL404: \nL405: \nL406: In this section we introduce a novel grammatical analysis\nL407: task for anytime part-of-speech (POS) tagging from continu-\nL408: ous speech recognition. It consists in a supervised classi\ufb01ca-\nL409: tion task in which the aim is to continuously provide the POS\nL410: Tagging estimation for each 10 ms frame of speech signal. \nL411: \nL412: \nL413: Fig. 2. HTR architecture: the main model we propose to address\nL414: the hierarchical task SP\u2192PH\u2192WD \u2192POS. The architecture receive the\nL415: features extracted from the speech signal with MFCC algorithm each 10 ms.\nL416: The \ufb01rst layer is optimized for SP\u2192PH (Task 1) the second layer is optimized\nL417: for PH\u2192WD (Task 2) and \ufb01nally the third layer is optimized for WD\u2192POS\nL418: (Task 3).\nL419: \nL420: \nL421: Accordingly the approaches evaluated on this task must be\nL422: suitable for real-time implementations.\nL423: For this purposes we focus on the TIMIT [21] corpus which\nL424: is widely used in the \ufb01eld of continuous speech recognition.\nL425: The dataset contains recordings from 630 American speakers\nL426: and each speaker read 10 phonetically rich sentences. Each\nL427: frame of 10 ms is labelled with a phone and a word class with\nL428: a total of 61 phones and 6012 words. We divided the dataset in\nL429: a training set containing 540 speaker and a test set containing\nL430: 90 speaker. We use the last 135 speaker for the validation set.\nL431: \nL432: As in [9] we reduce the number of phones from 61 to 51\nL433: merging similar sounds. In order to keep ef\ufb01ciency in training\nL434: processes we considered only the 50 most frequent words of\nL435: the corpus each having one output label and merging the\nL436: others in a single out-of-vocabolary (OOV) label.\nL437: We extended the dataset by computing the POS tagging\nL438: by using SpaCy tools for each sentence with a total of 17\nL439: grammatical elements. The POS labelling is performed by\nL440: computing a POS tag for each word. Then the POS tag is\nL441: associated with a class label for each frame that belongs to the\nL442: duration of the word in the speech signal. Finally a silence\nL443: label is considered as an additional class in correspondence\nL444: with silence frames in the speech signal. For each 10ms the\nL445: Mel Frequency Cepstral Coef\ufb01cients (MFCC) [9] algorithm\nL446: computes the 39 components used as input for the architectures\nL447: (see [9] for the setup of MFCC).\nL448: In order to form the whole hierarchical task for POS tagging\nL449: and to de\ufb01ne the different architectures for the experiments\nL450: we consider 10 sub-tasks listed in the following: SP\u2192PH\nL451: (predict phones from speech) PH\u2192WD (words from phones)\nL452: WD\u2192POS (POS from words) SP\u2192WD (words from speech)\nL453: SP\u2192POS (POS from speech) PH\u2192POS (POS from phones)\nL454: WD\u2192POS (POS from words)  WD(lb)\u2192POS (POS from\nL455: words labels) PH(lb)\u2192WD (words from phones labels) and\nL456: PH(lb)\u2192POS (POS from phones labels).  In all tasks the\nL457: evaluation is performed by computing the frame error rate\nL458: (FER) which is the ratio between the number of correctly\nL459: classi\ufb01ed time steps and the total number of time steps.\nL460: For each task the model selection is performed with a\nL461: random search evaluating the performance on the validation\nL462: set. For each trial we sample the hyper-parameters spectral\nL463: radius in the following way: \u03c1(l) and input norm \u03c3(l) from a\nL464: logarithmic distribution in [0.1 10] leak-rate a(l) from a uni-\nL465: form distribution in [0.1 1] and ridge (regularisation) \u03bb(l) from\nL466: a discrete uniform distribution in [100 10\u22121 ... 10\u22127 10\u22128].\nL467: In training phase a search grid is performed on \u03bb(l) consid-\nL468: ering values reported above. As in standard RC each hyper-\nL469: parametrization (i.e. \u03c1(l) \u03c3(l) a(l) and \u03bb(l)) is evaluated aver-\nL470: aging the results obtained by randomly initialized architectures\nL471: (that we call guesses). In this work we consider 5 guesses.\nL472: In order to keep the execution of the hyper-parameter search\nL473: in a reasonable time we did not optimize the input scaling of\nL474: each MFCC input component individually. Triefenbach et al.\nL475: [9] optimized inputs scaling by clusters: optimizing the scaling\nL476: for signals signal derivative (delta) and signal acceleration\nL477: (i.e. delta-delta). Moreover since we have several experiments\nL478: to perform (due to a thorough architectural comparison) on a\nL479: signi\ufb01cantly big corpus we performed preliminary experiments\nL480: to \ufb01x a proper number of units. We \ufb01nd that 1000 units are\nL481: a good tradeoff between accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency considering\nL482: also that the proposed approach must be ef\ufb01ciently executable\nL483: in real-time. Accordingly in the following all experiments are\nL484: performed by using NR \nL485: = 1000 for each ESN layer.\nL486: The 3 main architectures that we consider in this paper are\nL487: listed in Table I. Therefore in HTR \ufb01rst the layer ESN 1 (see\nL488: Figure 2) is optimized to estimate phones (PH) from speech \nL489: \nL490: \nL491: TABLE I\nL492: THE TASK STRUCTURE OF THE ARCHITECTURES HTR HRC AND ESN.\nL493: \nL494: \nL495: Name\nL496: HTR\nL497: HRC\nL498: ESN \nL499: \nL500: \nL501: Architecture\nL502: SP\u2192PH \u2192WD\u2192POS\nL503: SP\u2192POS\u2192POS\u2192POS\nL504: SP\u2192POS\nL505: \nL506: \nL507: (SP) then ESN 2 is optimized to recognize words (WD) from\nL508: phones and \ufb01nally ESN 3 is optimized to estimate POS tagging\nL509: from words. Differently in HRC case ESN 1 is optimized to\nL510: estimate POS from HRC while ESN 2 and ESN 3 are both\nL511: optimized to estimate POS tagging from POS tagging. The\nL512: ESN in I is optimize to estimate POS tagging from speech\nL513: implementing 3000 units (the same total number of units of\nL514: HTR and HRC).\nL515: \nL516: \nL517: V. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nL518: \nL519: \nL520: A. Architecture Comparison on the Anytime POS Task\nL521: Here we present the results obtained by HTR HRC and\nL522: ESN on the Anytime POS Task. Table II shows the test FERs\nL523: achieved by HTR HRC and ESN. The HTR obtained the\nL524: best result with a test FER of 45.51% followed by HRC and\nL525: ESN that achieved 49.55% and 53.40% test FER respectively.\nL526: First we can note that HRC achieve 4.08 FER points less\nL527: \nL528: \nL529: TABLE II\nL530: TEST FERS: HTR HRC AND ESN ON THE ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL531: \nL532: \nL533: Architecture\nL534: HTR\nL535: HRC\nL536: ESN \nL537: \nL538: \nL539: Test\nL540: 45.51(0.04)%\nL541: 49.32(0.12)%\nL542: 53.40(0.15)%\nL543: \nL544: \nL545: than ESN. This highlights that solving the Anytime POS task\nL546: with a pipeline of ESN modules as performed in HRC allows\nL547: us to improve the results with respect to the use of a single\nL548: ESN module (containing a total equivalent number of reservoir\nL549: units). Moreover the hierarchical-task approach implemented\nL550: by HTR (i.e. considering progressively more abstract sub-tasks\nL551: in higher layers) allows us to have a further improvement on\nL552: the Anytime POS task outperforming HRC architecture by\nL553: 4.04 FER points.\nL554: \nL555: \nL556: B. Improving HRC Perf. by increasing the number of layers\nL557: In this section we show the experimental results obtained\nL558: by HRC on the Anytime POS Task by varying the number\nL559: of layers. Table III shows the test FERs achieved by HRC\nL560: considering progressively more layers in the architecture (i.e.\nL561: 1 2 and 3 layers). The HRC architecture obtained 50.35%\nL562: 49.55% and 49.32% test FER for 1 2 and 3 layers re-\nL563: spectively. We can note that the error obtained by the HRC\nL564: architecture decreases when the number of layers increases.\nL565: This con\ufb01rms the ability of the next layers to correct the errors\nL566: made by the previous layers as achieved in [9]. This aspect\nL567: is also interesting in relation to results obtained by the ESN\nL568: with 3000 units (see Table II).

Qualitative Comparison Between HTR and HRC\nL764: In this section we show a qualitative comparison between\nL765: HTR and HRC of the Anytime POS estimation when the \nL766: \nL767: \nL768: In Figures 4b c and d each line represents the value of\nL769: an output neuron over the time each neuron is associated to\nL770: a POS class and the output of the model at each time step\nL771: is the POS class associated to the neuron with the maximum\nL772: value. The estimated POS tags are shown in Figures 4 above\nL773: the output values. From Figure 4b we can see that in many\nL774: areas the estimation is not precise since some output units\nL775: have overlapped ranges. For instance after the estimation of\nL776: silence (label #h) in the \ufb01rsts time steps the model suffers\nL777: from uncertainty with a consequent decrease of accuracy for\nL778: those predictions. Interestingly from Figure 4c we can see\nL779: that considering one more layer in the HTR architecture the\nL780: estimation is signi\ufb01cantly improved since the predictions are\nL781: more clearly separated.

Qualitative Analysis of HRT\nL1049: \nL1050: \nL1051: In this section we present the qualitative analysis performed\nL1052: on the HTR architecture with 3 layers (SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS).\nL1053: Figures 6b c and d show the predictions of the layer 1 2\nL1054: and 3 relative to the phone words and POS classi\ufb01cations\nL1055: respectively. As we expected since tasks are different and\nL1056: progressively more abstract we can see from Figures 6b and\nL1057: 6c that the layers values goes from an higher to a lower\nL1058: frequency of prediction. This means that the readouts trained\nL1059: on different kinds of tasks with different label frequencies\nL1060: force progressively the dynamic of the layers from high to\nL1061: low frequencies.\nL1062: In Figures 6c and d at the dashed vertical lines we can see\nL1063: an interesting example in which the model is able to estimate\nL1064: the correct POS even if the word is OOV (i.e. label class for \nL1065: \nL1066: \nL1067: 0.5\nL1068: \nL1069: \nL1070: 0\nL1071: \nL1072: \nL1073: 0  50  100\nL1074: Time steps150  200  250\nL1075: \nL1076: \nL1077: Fig. 6.

This highlights that\nL1089: although the last layer is fed without the direct information\nL1090: of the previous word the carried information is rich enough\nL1091: to perform a correct classi\ufb01cation.

Architectural Variants of HRT\nL1098: \nL1099: \nL1100: In this section we present the results of other architec-\nL1101: tural variants of HTR. First we compare SP\u2192PH\u2192POS\nL1102: with SP\u2192WD\u2192POS in order to evaluate a variant of HTR\nL1103: without the phone recognition task. Table V shows the test\nL1104: errors obtained by the two considered architectural vari-\nL1105: ants. Interestingly SP\u2192WD\u2192POS is outperformed by both\nL1106: SP\u2192PH\u2192POS and SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS (see Table IV). This\nL1107: highlights that it is important to address the task SP\u2192PH for\nL1108: layer 1 instead of addressing directly the task SP\u2192WD.\nL1109: Moreover the results presented in Table IV suggest that\nL1110: the 3rd layer (related to the task WD\u2192POS) plays a relevant\nL1111: role in the achievement of the global task. Indeed the error\nL1112: decreased from 47.62% to 45.51% FER. This highlights the\nL1113: \nL1114: TABLE V\nL1115: TEST FERS ACHIEVED BY ARCHITECTURES SP\u2192PH\u2192POS AND\nL1116: SP\u2192WD\u2192POS ON THE ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL1117: \nL1118: \nL1119: Architectures\nL1120: SP\u2192PH\u2192POS\nL1121: SP\u2192WD\u2192POS \nL1122: \nL1123: \nL1124: FER\nL1125: 47.62(0.12)%\nL1126: 48.52(0.32)% \nL1127: \nL1128: \nL1129: TABLE VII\nL1130: TEST FERS ACHIEVED BY WD(LB)\u2192POS PH(LB)\u2192WD\u2192POS AND\nL1131: PH(LB)\u2192POS ARCHITECTURES ON ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL1132: \nL1133: \nL1134: Architectures\nL1135: WD(lb)\u2192POS\nL1136: PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS\nL1137: PH(lb)\u2192POS \nL1138: \nL1139: \nL1140: FER\nL1141: 30.03(0.36)%\nL1142: 41.40(0.13)%\nL1143: 41.81(0.31)%\nL1144: \nL1145: \nL1146: importance of the 3rd layer in the correction of errors made\nL1147: by the previous layer. Then the obtained results highlight\nL1148: that SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS is the best choice to improve the\nL1149: performance on the Anytime POS task.\nL1150: However the use of only 50 words out of 6012 for the\nL1151: WD\u2192POS task could be a bottleneck for the richness of the\nL1152: information used to solve the POS task. Therefore a skip\nL1153: connection between layer 1 and layer 3 could carry more\nL1154: information and accordingly improve the results. The skip\nL1155: connection is obtained by concatenating the input of ESN 3\nL1156: with the output of ESN 1 (see Figure 2) we call this variant\nL1157: HTR-skip. Table VI shows the test errors achieved by HTR\nL1158: and HTR-skip. We can see from Table VI that HTR-skip and\nL1159: \nL1160: \nL1161: TABLE VI\nL1162: TEST FERS ACHIEVED BY HTR AND HTR-SKIP ON ANYTIME POS TASK.\nL1163: \nL1164: \nL1165: Architectures\nL1166: HTR\nL1167: HTR-skip \nL1168: \nL1169: \nL1170: FER\nL1171: 45.511(0.04)%\nL1172: 45.506(0.04)%\nL1173: \nL1174: \nL1175: HTR obtained very similar results. The lack of performance\nL1176: improvement and the qualitative analysis shown in Figure 6\nL1177: suggest that the ESN 2 (see Figure 2) can carry enough rich\nL1178: information even using only the estimation of the 50 words +\nL1179: OOV label.\nL1180: Overall the results obtained by HRC in Table III (i.e. with-\nL1181: out intermediate tasks) and the results obtained by architectural\nL1182: variants in Table V (i.e. with only SP\u2192PH or SP\u2192WD\nL1183: intermediate task) suggest that using several intermediate tasks\nL1184: is crucial to obtain the best performance.\nL1185: \nL1186: \nL1187: G. Ground Truth Architectures\nL1188: Here we present the results obtained by architectural vari-\nL1189: ants which address the Anytime POS task starting from the\nL1190: ground truth of phones or words instead of starting from the\nL1191: speech signal. In this way these architectures represent the\nL1192: performance that the model can reach on the Anytime POS\nL1193: task with the help of a perfect phone recognition system (i.e.\nL1194: PH(lb)) or a perfect word recognition system (i.e. WD(lb)).\nL1195: Table VII shows the test FERs obtained by WD(lb)\u2192POS\nL1196: PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS and PH(lb)\u2192POS where WD(lb) and\nL1197: PH(lb) are the ground truth of words and phones respectively.\nL1198: As expected WD(lb)\u2192POS obtained the best performance\nL1199: with a FER of 30.03% followed by PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS with\nL1200: 41.40% FER and PH(lb)\u2192POS with 41.81% FER.\nL1201: \nL1202: \nL1203: H. Comparing Results\nL1204: Comparing results from TableVII and Table IV it seems\nL1205: counter-intuitive that adding the WD task in-between the \nL1206: \nL1207: \nL1208: PH\u2192POS \ufb02ow improves performance mostly when starting\nL1209: from the speech signal (from 47.62% to 45.51%) and not\nL1210: when starting from the ground truth phones (from 41.81% to\nL1211: 41.81%). Therefore it suggests that the WD task is actually\nL1212: used to correct errors made at the phone-level (ESN 1) in\nL1213: the full HTR architecture (i.e. SP\u2192PH\u2192WD\u2192POS). This is\nL1214: another aspect that con\ufb01rms the usefulness of our Hierarchical-\nL1215: Task approach since multiple tasks with an increasing level\nL1216: of abstraction enable the correction of previous errors.\nL1217: Moreover we can say that the performance achieved by\nL1218: WD(lb)\u2192POS architecture (30.03% FER) shows that ob-\nL1219: taining POS labels starting from phones (PH) signi\ufb01cantly\nL1220: increases the dif\ufb01culty of the task compared to starting from\nL1221: words (WD).  Therefore this suggests that using the WD\nL1222: task in the full HTR architecture is crucial to have better\nL1223: performances on POS tagging.\nL1224: Finally it is worth mentioning that the baseline performance\nL1225: that we could expect to reach with the full HTR architecture\nL1226: (41.40% FER with PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS) starting from the\nL1227: speech signal is not so far away from the 45.51% obtained\nL1228: starting from a perfect phone recognition system PH(lb).\nL1229: \nL1230: \nL1231: VI. DISCUSSION\nL1232: \nL1233: \nL1234: In this work with the HTR architecture we introduced\nL1235: a novel tool suitable for real-time sentence parsing [27] of\nL1236: continuous speech. For this purpose we introduced a novel\nL1237: task for the Anytime POS tagging from continuous speech\nL1238: extending the TIMIT corpus. The HTR is composed by a\nL1239: hierarchy of ESNs in which each ESN is optimized on a\nL1240: different task (i.e. phone word POS tag recognition). The\nL1241: level of abstraction of the task increases when the layer\u2019s level\nL1242: increases.\nL1243: The qualitative experiments performed on the output values\nL1244: of the layers highlight that the learning of sub-tasks with\nL1245: a progressively decreasing temporal frequency of labels for\nL1246: higher layers force a progressively low temporal frequency\nL1247: dynamic according to the depth of the architecture. This ability\nL1248: can help the HTR to progressively develop a proper level\nL1249: of abstraction of the input signal in order to improve the\nL1250: performance of the whole task.\nL1251: Moreover we quantitatively compared HTR with a typical\nL1252: hierarchical reservoir architecture that implements the estima-\nL1253: tion of POS tags in each layer. Then we also compare the HTR\nL1254: with several architectural variants. The quantitative results\nL1255: show that the whole hierarchy of sub-tasks implemented in\nL1256: HTR is crucial to signi\ufb01cantly improve the performance.\nL1257: Finally HTR obtain only about 4 points of FER less than the\nL1258: \nL1259: architecture trained starting from the outputs of a perfect phone\nL1260: recognition system (PH(lb)\u2192WD\u2192POS). We can conclude\nL1261: that HTR is competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches\nL1262: in the RC \ufb01eld on the Anytime POS task.\nL1263: Overall the HTR model and the Anytime POS task intro-\nL1264: duced in this paper are interesting tools for further studies\nL1265: regarding the language comprehension in neuroscience ap-\nL1266: proaches [28] [29] or for the implementation of a real-time\nL1267: human-robot interaction (HRI) [5]\u2013[7] [30].\nL1268: In future work it would be interesting to get inspiration\nL1269: from neurobiological \ufb01ndings on brain hierarchy: in primate\nL1270: brains there are feedforward and feedback connections be-\nL1271: tween brain areas of different abstraction levels [12]. Indeed\nL1272: information does not only go from sensory (i.e. less abstract)\nL1273: to more integrated areas (i.e. more abstract)  it also \ufb02ows\nL1274: from more abstract to less abstract areas. Thus hierarchical\nL1275: models could be designed to incorporate these bottom-up\nL1276: processing (i.e. from sensory to more abstract representations)\nL1277: and top-down processing (i.e. from abstract to more sensory\nL1278: representations).  In order to apply this idea to the current\nL1279: HTR model composed of feedforward reservoirs we could\nL1280: add backwards reservoirs (i.e. feedback reservoirs)1.  These\nL1281: backwards reservoirs would be trained to predict a less abstract\nL1282: task (of the layer n \u2212 1) given a more abstract task (of the\nL1283: layer n).  This would enable these backwards reservoirs to\nL1284: predict and update low-level representations based on more\nL1285: high-level representations. Most importantly this could enable\nL1286: to not only predict but also to postdict [31] low-level outputs:\nL1287: this corresponds to predict the past given current information\nL1288: i.e. update previous beliefs or perceptions. The integration\nL1289: of both prediction and postdiction in an architecture reminds\nL1290: the ability of bi-LSTMs to use both past and future input\nL1291: features [32]. Consequently the output representations may\nL1292: need to be updated in order to use a kind of a-temporal\nL1293: representation of readouts: i.e. representing outputs for t \u2212 n\nL1294: t and t + n for any time step n instead of just representing\nL1295: the current output at time step t.\nL1296: The proposed HTR architecture is a promising \ufb01rst step\nL1297: towards general hierarchical modeling of language compre-\nL1298: hension and production starting from speech signal. Further\nL1299: works in this line of research could focus on the addition\nL1300: of more abstract layers to perform tasks such as sentence\nL1301: chunking/segmentation Name Entity Recognition Sentiment\nL1302: Analysis or Semantic-Role Labelling [33]. Moreover because\nL1303: the long-term goal of this architecture is to model brain\nL1304: processes thus is not limited to speech or natural language\nL1305: processing but suf\ufb01ciently general to be applied to a variety\nL1306: of tasks such as gesture recognition or sensorimotor learning.\nL1307: \nL1308: \nL1309: REFERENCES\nL1310: \nL1311: \nL1312: [1] M.

They do so partly due to the evolution of morphological and neural structures. These structures capture features of environments shared between generations to bias and speed up lifetime learning. In this work, we propose a computational model for studying a mechanism that can enable such a process. We adopt a computational framework based on meta reinforcement learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development. At the evolutionary scale, we evolve reservoirs, a family of recurrent neural networks that differ from conventional networks in that one optimizes not the weight values but hyperparameters of the architecture: the later control macro-level properties, such as memory and dynamics. At the developmental scale, we employ these evolved reservoirs to facilitate the learning of a behavioral policy through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within an RL agent, a reservoir encodes the environment state before providing it to an action policy. We evaluate our approach on several 2D and 3D simulated environments. Our results show that the evolution of reservoirs can improve the learning of diverse challenging tasks. We study in particular three hypotheses: the use of an architecture combining reservoirs and reinforcement learning could enable (1) solving tasks with partial observability, (2) generating oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks, and (3) facilitating the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unknown during the evolution phase.\n\n###### Keywords: \n\nMeta Reinforcement Learning Reservoir Computing Evolutionary Computation \n\n**footnotetext: Equal first authors\u2021\u2021footnotetext: Equal last authors\u2020\u2020footnotetext: Work done as an intern at Flowers and Mnemosyne  \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nAnimals demonstrate remarkable adaptability to their environments, a trait honed through the evolution of their morphological and neural structures [\u30100\u202043\u3011][\u30101\u202028\u3011]. Animals are born equipped with both hard-wired behavior routines (e.g. breathing, motor babbling) and learning capabilities to adapt from experience. The costs and benefits of evolving hard-wired behaviors vs. learning capabilities depends on different factors, a central one being the level of unpredictability of environmental conditions across generations [\u30102\u202039\u3011][\u30103\u202015\u3011]. Phenotypic traits addressing environmental challenges that are shared across many generations are more likely to evolve hard-wired (e.g. breathing), while traits whose utility can hardly be predicted from its utility in previous generations are likely to be learned through individual development (e.g. learning a specific language). For instance, some hard-wired functions, such as limb babbling supported by central pattern generators (CPGs), might have evolved to generically facilitate the learning of diverse behaviors [\u30104\u202022\u3011](e.g. CPGs supporting the learning of locomotion, pointing and vocalizations in humans). Another example is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which has been proposed to act as a reservoir of computations: enabling to represent abstractions from inputs within a high-dimensional non-linear space which could be decoded by other areas [\u30105\u202021\u3011][\u30106\u202012\u3011].\n\nThis prompts an intriguing question: How can neural structures, optimized at an evolutionary scale, enhance the capabilities of agents to learn complex tasks at a developmental scale? To address this question, we propose to model the interplay between evolution and development as two nested adaptive loops: evolution optimizes the generation of neural structures through natural selection over generations, shaping developmental learning during an agent\u2019s lifetime (Fig.\u00a01). This model agrees with recent views on evolution that emphasize the importance of both loops for the evolution of complex skills [\u30107\u202018\u3011, \u30108\u202017\u3011].\n\nFor this aim, we propose a novel computational approach, called Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning (ER-MRL), integrating mechanisms from Reservoir Computing (RC), Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). We use RL as a model of learning at a developmental scale [\u30109\u202027\u3011]. In RL, an agent interacts with a simulated environment through actions and observations, receiving rewards according to the task at hand. The objective is to learn an action policy from experience, mapping the observations perceived by the agent to actions in order to maximize cumulative reward over time. The policy is usually modeled as a deep neural network which is iteratively optimized through gradient descent. We use RC as a model of how a genome, encoding macro properties of the agent morphology, can shape the generation of neural structures with rich intrinsic dynamics. In RC, the connection weights of a recurrent neural network (RNN) are generated from global hyperparameters (HPs) controlling macro-level properties of the network related to connectivity, memory and sensitivity. Our choice of using RC relies on its parallels with the biological brain structures discussed earlier. In particular, RC has been proposed as a relevant model of both PFC and CPGs[\u301010\u202013\u3011][\u301011\u202047\u3011]. Additionally, because it is a cheap and versatile paradigm, it has demonstrated noteworthy evolutionary properties [\u301012\u202036\u3011], making it an ideal choice for investigating our research question. In our proposed ER-MRL architecture, the generated neural structure acts as a reservoir of computations, taking as input the sensory-motor activity of the agent, and is connected to the RL action policy.\n\nWe use Meta-RL as a model of how evolution shapes development [\u301013\u20208\u3011][\u301014\u202030\u3011]. Meta-RL considers an outer loop, akin to evolution, optimizing HPs of an inner loop, akin to development. At the evolutionary scale (the outer loop), we use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a genome specifying HPs of reservoirs. At a developmental scale (the inner loop), a RL agent equipped with a generated reservoir learns an action policy to maximize cumulative reward in a simulated environment. Thus, the objective of the outer evolutionary loop is to optimize macro properties of reservoirs in order to facilitate the learning of an action policy in the inner developmental loop.\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: A simplified view of the evolution of brain structures (left) and the parallel with our computational approach (right). We can observe on the left of the figure the interplay between two loops : an evolutionary one that modifies the generating parameters of neural structures, and a developmental one where agents equipped with such neural structures learn to interact with their environment. We propose a computational framework (right) where an evolutionary algorithm optimizes hyperparameters that generate neural structures called reservoirs. These reservoirs are then integrated into RL agents that learn an action policy to maximize their reward in an environment\n\nUsing this computational model, we run experiments in diverse simulated environments, e.g. 2D environments where the agent learns how to balance a pendulum and 3D environments where the agent learns how to control complex morphologies. These experiments provide support to three main hypotheses for how evolved reservoirs can affect intralife learning. First, they can facilitate solving partially-observable tasks, where the agent lacks access to all the information necessary to solve the task. In this case, we test the hypothesis that the recurrent nature of the reservoir will enable learning to infer the unobservable information. Second, it can generate oscillatory dynamics useful for solving locomotion tasks. In this case, the reservoir acts as a meta-learned CPG. Third, it can facilitate the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unknown during the evolution phase. This hypothesis is motivated by the core hypothesis in meta-learning that evolving features of agents at two time-scales leads to the ability of learning to adapt to unknown environments. In our case, our expectation is that HPs of reservoirs evolved across different environments will capture some useful abstract properties for developmental adaptation.\n\nIn Section\u00a0\u301015\u20202\u3011, we detail the methods underlying our proposed model, including RL (Section\u00a0\u301016\u20202.1\u3011), Meta-RL (Section\u00a0\u301017\u20202.2\u3011), RC (Section\u00a0\u301018\u20202.3\u3011), and EAs (Section\u00a0\u301019\u20202.4\u3011). We then explain their integration into the outlined architecture (Section\u00a0\u301020\u20202.5\u3011). Our results, aligned with the three hypotheses, are presented in Section\u00a0\u301021\u20203\u3011. Computational specifics and supplementary experiments can be found in the appendix. The source code is accessible at \u301022\u2020this link\u2020anonymous.4open.science\u3011.\n\n##  2 Methods\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: Our proposed architecture, called ER-MRL, integrates several ML paradigms. We consider an RL agent learning an action policy (a), having access to a reservoir (c). We consider two nested adaptive loops in the spirit of Meta-RL (b). Our proposed architecture (d) consists in evolving HPs for the generation of reservoirs in an outer loop. In an inner loop, the agent learns an action policy, that takes as input the neural activation of the reservoir. The policy is trained using RL in order to maximize episodic return. Section\u00a0\u301015\u20202\u3011 provides the computational details of each ML paradigm.  \n\n###  2.1 Reinforcement Learning as a model of development\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) involves an agent that interacts with an environment by taking actions, receiving rewards, and learning an action policy in order to maximize its accumulated rewards (Fig.\u00a02.a). This interaction is formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [\u301023\u202031\u3011]. An MDP is represented as a tuple , where is the set of possible states of the environment, is the set of available actions to the agent, is the transition function specifying the environment dynamics (how the state at time is determined by the current state and action at time ), represents the initial state distribution, and defines the reward received by the agent for a specific state-action pair. In an episode lasting time steps, the agent observes the environment\u2019s state , takes an action , and receives a reward . The environment then transitions to the next step according to . The objective of RL is to learn a policy that maps observed states to actions in order to maximize the cumulative discounted reward over time, where [\u301024\u202041\u3011]. The parameter discounts future rewards during decision making, and it\u2019s a key factor in the learning process.\n\nIn Deep RL [\u301025\u202019\u3011], the policy is implemented as an artificial neural network, whose connection weights are iteratively learned according to the agent\u2019s experience in the environment. In all conducted experiments, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [\u301026\u202035\u3011] (see details in Section \u301027\u20205.1.1\u3011).\n\n###  2.2 Meta Reinforcement Learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development\n\nWhile RL has lead to impressive applications [\u301028\u202023\u3011][\u301029\u202037\u3011][\u301030\u20204\u3011], it suffers from several limitations: the learned policy is specific to the task at hand and does not necessarily generalize well to variations of the environment; it learns from scratch and requires a large amount of data to converge. Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) [\u301031\u20203\u3011] has been proposed to address these issues, where the objective is for an agent to learn how to learn (hence the term meta-learning), i.e. to learn how to quickly adapt to new tasks or environments that were not encountered during the meta learning phase. It is based on two nested adaptive loops : an outer loop, analogous to evolution, optimizes the HPs of an inner loop, analogous to development (Fig.\u00a02.b)[\u301014\u202030\u3011][\u301032\u202029\u3011]. The objective of the outer loop is to maximize the average performance of the inner loop on a distribution of environments. Formally, a set of HPs are meta-optimized in the outer loop, with the objective of maximizing the average performance of a population of RL agents conditioned by . In [\u301033\u202010\u3011], the HPs correspond to the initial weights of a Deep RL policy , those weights being then learned through RL in the inner loop. In [\u301034\u20209\u3011], instead corresponds to the weights of a RNN, the RNN dynamics itself acting as a learning mechanism in the inner loop. In this paper, we instead propose to leverage the RC framework where corresponds to macro-level properties of a RNN, as explained in the next subsection.\n\n###  2.3 Reservoir computing as a model of neural structure generation\n\nAs noted above, a widely used approach in Meta-RL consists of directly optimizing the weights of a RNN, through backpropagation, in the outer loop. While this technique has demonstrated remarkable efficacy, it is ill-suited for addressing the research question outlined in the introduction for several compelling reasons. Primarily, it lacks biological plausibility, as evolutionary-scale adaptation is unlikely to hinge on backpropagation mechanisms [\u301035\u202040\u3011]. Additionally, the notion that evolution directly fine-tunes neural network weights contradicts established biological principles. Rather, it is more probable that a genome encodes higher-level properties of neural architectures, leaving the precise instantiation (e.g., connection weights) to morphogenesis during individual development [\u301036\u202048\u3011] . Within this framework, we choose to optimize recurrent neural networks based on the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm for several reasons outlined in Section\u00a0\u301037\u20201\u3011. This approach aligns with evolutionary and biological principles, as it allows the generation of neural structures from a set of HPs, focusing on macro properties, rather than a direct evolution of neural network weights.\n\nRC [\u301038\u202020\u3011] emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in training recurrent neural networks. Unlike traditional deep learning, where intensive training is required for the entire network, RC focuses on training only the output layer while keeping the input and recurrent weights randomly fixed. The fundamental idea behind RC is to create a dynamic reservoir of computation from recurrently and randomly connected neurons (called the \"reservoir\"). A random recurrent network plays the role of a \u2019reservoir\u2019 of computations, where inputs are nonlinearly recombined over time, providing a set of dynamic features from which a linear \u2019readout\u2019 is trained: such training is equivalent to selecting and combining interesting features to solve the given task (Fig.\u00a02.c). Several HPs play a crucial role in shaping the efficiency of RC. This includes the number of neurons in the reservoir, the spectral radius , input scaling , and leak rate , that we explain with more detail in Section\u00a0\u301039\u20205.1.2\u3011 in the appendix. In conclusion, RC provides an alternative to deep learning approaches by providing a projection of inputs in \u201crich\u201d high-dimensional dynamics without the need to tune any recurrent weights. This literally provides computations \"on the shelf\" ready to be used, which is an interesting property useful at different stages of evolution. In this paper, we propose to meta-optimize reservoir\u2019s HPs in a Meta-RL outer loop, using evolutionary algorithms explained in the next subsection. We will then explain how we propose to integrate RC with RL in section \u301020\u20202.5\u3011.\n\n###  2.4 Evolutionary algorithms as a model of evolution\n\nThe optimization in the outer loop, which can be analogous to evolution, of a Meta RL algorithm can be directly informed by Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) [\u301040\u20202\u3011]. EAs draws inspiration from the fundamental principles of biological evolution[\u301041\u202033\u3011], where species improve their fitness through the selection and variation of their genomes. EAs iteratively enhance a population of candidate parameterized solutions to a given optimization problem, iteratively selecting those with higher fitness levels (i.e higher performance of the solution) and mutating their parameters for the next generation.\n\nIn our approach, we utilize the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) [\u301042\u202011\u3011] as our designated evolutionary algorithm in order to meta-optimize HPs of reservoirs. In CMA-ES, a population of HPs candidates is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with mean and covariance matrix . The fitness of each sample of the population is evaluated (see Section\u00a0\u301020\u20202.5\u3011 for how we do it in our proposed method). The Gaussian distribution is then updated by weighting each sample proportionally to its fitness; resulting in a new mean and covariance matrix that are biased toward solutions with higher fitness. This process continues iteratively until either convergence towards sufficiently high fitness values of the generated HPs is achieved, or until a predefined threshold of candidates is reached.\n\n###  2.5 Our method : Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning (EV-MRL)\n\n####  2.5.1 General approach\n\nOur objective is to devise a computational framework to address a fundamental question: How can neural structures adapt at an evolutionary scale, enabling agents to better adapt to their environment at a developmental scale? For this aim, we aim to integrate the Machine Learning paradigms presented above. The architecture is illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.d and the optimization procedure in Fig.\u00a03. We call our method ER-MRL, for \"Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning\". The ER-MRL method encompasses two nested optimization loops (as in Meta-RL, section\u00a0\u301017\u20202.2\u3011). In the outer loop, operating at an evolutionary scale, HPs for generating a reservoir (section\u00a0\u301018\u20202.3\u3011) are optimized using an evolutionary algorithm (section\u00a0\u301019\u20202.4\u3011). In the inner loop, focused on a developmental scale, a RL algorithm (Section\u00a0\u301016\u20202.1\u3011) learns an action policy using the reservoir state as inputs. In other words, the outer loop meta-learns HPs able to generate reservoirs resulting in maximal averages performance on multiple inner loops. The whole process is illustrated in Fig.\u00a03 and detailed below.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 3: In the evolution phase (top), CMA-ES refines Reservoir HPs . At each generation of the evolution loop (left), a population of HPs is sampled from the CMA-ES Gaussian distribution. Each undergoes evaluation on multiple random seeds, generating multiple reservoirs. An ER-MRL agent is created for each reservoir, with its action policy being trained from the states of that reservoir (lighter grey frames). The fitness of a sampled is determined by the average score of all ER-MRL generated from it (mid-grey frames). The fitness values are used to update the CMA-ES distribution for the next generation (dotted arrow). This process iterates until a predetermined threshold is reached. In the Testing phase (bottom), the best set of HPs from all CMA-ES samples is employed. Multiple reservoirs are generated within ER-MRL agents, and their performance is evaluated.  \n\n####  2.5.2 Inner loop\n\nTo represent the development of an agent, we consider a RL agent (Section\u00a0\u301016\u20202.1\u3011) that interacts with an environment through observation , actions and rewards at each time step (Fig.\u00a02.a). In our proposed ER-MRL method, this agent is composed of three main parts : a reservoir generated by HPs (the , the and the refer to Section\u00a0\u301039\u20205.1.2\u3011 for more details), a feed forward action policy network and a RL algorithm. At each time step, we feed the reservoir with the current , and the previous action and reward and (Fig.\u00a02.d). Contrarily to standard RL, our agent does not directly observe the observation of the environment\u2019s state , but the context of the reservoir instead (i.e. the vector of all reservoir\u2019s neurons activations at time ). Because reservoirs are recurrent neural networks, not only encompasses information about the current time step, but also integrates information over previous time steps. We also use ER-MRL with two reservoir. In this case, we still generate the two reservoirs from a set of HPs , and the context given to the agent is the concatenation of both hidden states of the reservoirs. We then train our policy using RL.\n\n####  2.5.3 Outer loop\n\nThe outer loop employs the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) (Section\u00a0\u301019\u20202.4\u3011) to optimize reservoir HPs . The objective is to generate reservoirs which, on average over multiple agents, improve learning abilities. For each set of HPs, we assess the performance of our agents in multiple inner loops (we utilize 3 in our experiments), each one with a different random seed. Using different random seeds implies that, while using the same HPs set, each agent will be initialized with different connection weights of both their reservoirs, their policies and the initial environment state. Note that while the generated reservoirs have different connection weights, they share the same macro-properties in terms of spectral radius, input scaling and leak rate (since they are generated from the same HPs set). In assessing an agent\u2019s fitness within its RL environment, we compute the mean episodic reward over the final 10 episodes of its training. To obtain the fitness of a reservoir HPs, we calculate the mean fitness of three agents across three different versions of the same environment. These steps are iterated until we reach a predetermined threshold of CMA-ES iterations (set at 900 in our experiments).\n\n####  2.5.4 Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate our method, we select the HPs that generated the best fitness function during the whole outer loop optimization with CMA-ES (see bottom of Fig.\u00a03). We then generate 10 ER-MRL agents with different random seeds (with a different reservoir sampled from for each seed, together with random initial policy weights ) and train the action policy of each agent using RL. We report our results in the next section, comparing the performance of these agents against RL agents using a feedfoward policy.\n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe designed experiments to answer the following hypotheses : The use of an architecture combining reservoirs and RL could enable (1) solving tasks with partial observability, (2) generating oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks, and (3) facilitating the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unseen during evolution phase.\n\n###  3.1 Evolved reservoirs improve learning in highly partially observable environments \n\nIn this section, we evaluate our approach on tasks with partial observability, where we purposefully remove information from the agent observations. Our hypothesis is that the evolved reservoir can help reconstructing this missing information. Partial observability is an important challenge in the field of RL, where agents have access to only a limited portion of environmental information to make decisions. This is referred to as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [\u301043\u202024\u3011] rather than a traditional MDP. In this context, the task becomes harder to learn, or even impossible, as the agent needs to make decisions based on an incomplete observation of the environment state. To explore this issue, our experimental framework is based on control environments, such as CartPole, Pendulum, and LunarLander (see details in Fig.\u00a08 of the appendix). We modify these environments by removing velocity-related observations, thus simulating a partially-observable task.\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate this issue with the first environment (CartPole), where the agent\u2019s goal is to keep the pole upright on the cart while it moves laterally. If we remove velocity-related observations (both for the cart and the pole\u2019s angle), a standard feedfoward RL agent cannot effectively solve the task. The reason is straightforward: without this information, the agent doesn\u2019t know the cart\u2019s movement direction or whether the pole is falling or rising. We apply the same process to the other two environments, removing all velocity-related observations for our agents. Can the ER-MRL architecture address this challenge? To find out, we independently evolve reservoirs using ER-MRL for each task. We search for effective HPs tailored to the partial observability of each environment. To evaluate our approach, we compare the performance of ER-MRL agents (equipped with the best reservoir from the evolution phase) on these three partially observable environments against an agent with a feedforward policy. This comparison will determine if reservoir utilization enhances learning in partially observable environments compared to feedfoward RL agents.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 4: Learning curves for partially observable tasks. The x-axis represents the number of timesteps during the training and the y-axis the mean episodic reward. Learning curves of our ER-MRL methods correspond to the testing phase described in the bottom of Fig.\u00a03. Vanilla RL corresponds to a feedforward policy RL agent. The curves and the shaded areas represent the mean and the standard deviation of the reward for 10 random seeds.\n\nFig.\u00a04 presents the results for the three selected partially observable tasks. We observe, as expected, that feedfoward RL agent cannot learn how to solve the task under partial observability (for the reasons mentioned above). In comparison, our approach leads to performance scores close to those obtained by a RL algorithm with full observability. This indicates that the evolved reservoir is able to reconstruct missing information related to velocities from its own internal recurrent dynamics. This confirms the hypothesis that an agent with a reservoir can solve partially observable tasks by using the internal reservoir state to reconstruct some information. We explain with more details why this method could work in Section\u00a0\u301044\u20205.4.1\u3011 of the appendix. The difference in results between the model with 2 reservoirs on LunarLander environment suggests that solving it requires encoding at least two different timescales dynamics. Our interpretation here is that solving LunarLander requires to deal with both an \"approaching\" and \"landing\" phase, unlike the two other environments.\n\n###  3.2 Evolved reservoirs could generate oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks\n\nIn this section, we evaluate our approach on agents with 3D morphology having to learn locomotion tasks shown in Fig.\u00a09We postulate that the integration of an evolved reservoir can engender oscillatory patterns that aid in coordinating body movements, akin to Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). CPGs, rooted in neurobiology, denote an interconnected network of neurons responsible for generating intricate and repetitive rhythmic patterns that govern movements or behaviors [\u30104\u202022\u3011] such as walking, swimming, or other cyclical movements. Existing scientific literature hypothesizes that reservoirs, possessing significant rhythmic components, share direct connections with CPGs [\u301045\u202034\u3011]. We propose to study this hypothesis using motor tasks involving rhythmic movements. We employed 3D MuJoCo environments (detailed in Fig.\u00a09 of the appendix), where the goal is to exert forces on various rotors of creatures to propel them forward. Notably, while the ultimate goal across these tasks remains constant (forward movement), the creatures exhibit diverse morphologies, including humanoids, insects, worms, bipeds, and more. Furthermore, the action and observation spaces vary for each morphology. We individually evaluate our ER-MRL architecture on each of these tasks.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] Figure 5: Learning curves for locomotion tasks. Same conventions as Fig.\u00a04\n\nOur approach demonstrates improved performance in some tasks (Ant, HalfCheetah, and Swimmer) compared to a standard RL baseline, particularly noticeable in the early stages of learning, as illustrated in Figure 5. This suggests that the evolved reservoir may generate beneficial oscillatory patterns, facilitating the learning of locomotion tasks, in line with the notion that reservoirs could potentially function as CPGs, aiding in solving motor tasks. Although carefully testing this hypotheses would require more analysis, we present in Section\u00a0\u301046\u20205.4.2\u3011 in the appendix preliminary data suggesting that the evolved reservoir is able to generate oscillatory dynamics that could facilitate learning in the Swimmer environment. However, as shown in Fig.\u00a05, performance enhancement was not observed in the Walker and Hopper environments compared to the RL baseline. Locomotion in both environments demands precise closed-loop control strategies to maintain an agent\u2019s equilibrium. In such cases, generated oscillatory patterns may not be as beneficial.\n\n###  3.3 Evolved reservoirs improve generalization on new tasks unseen during evolution phase\n\nIn this section, we address a key aspect of our study: the ability of evolved reservoirs to facilitate adaptation to novel environments. This inquiry is crucial in assessing the potential of evolved neural structures to generalize and enhance an agent\u2019s adaptability beyond the evolution phase. Building on the promising results of ER-MRL with two reservoirs in previous experiments, we focus exclusively on this configuration for comparison with the RL baseline.\n\n####  3.3.1 Generalizing across different morphologies with similar tasks\n\nIn prior experiments, ER-MRL demonstrated effectiveness in environments like Ant, HalfCheetah, and Swimmer. This success led us to explore whether reservoirs evolved for two of these tasks could be adaptable to the third, indicating potential generalization across different morphologies. However, due to variations in environments, including differences in morphology, observation and action spaces, and reward fun\nVisible: 0% - 48%", "summary": "[2312.06695] Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning (ar5iv.org)\n", "assets": []}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "[2312.06695] Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning", "url": "https://ar5iv.org/abs/2312.06695", "text": "\nURL: https://ar5iv.org/abs/2312.06695\n^{1}^{1}institutetext:  Flowers Team, Inria, France. ^{2}^{2}institutetext: Mnemosyne Team, Inria, France.\n\n# Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning\n\nCorentin L\u00e9ger*\u2020 1122 Gautier Hamon* 11 Eleni Nisioti 11 Xavier Hinaut\u2021 22 Cl\u00e9ment Moulin-Frier\u2021 11\n\n###### Abstract\n\nAnimals often demonstrate a remarkable ability to adapt to their environments during their lifetime. They do so partly due to the evolution of morphological and neural structures. These structures capture features of environments shared between generations to bias and speed up lifetime learning. In this work, we propose a computational model for studying a mechanism that can enable such a process. We adopt a computational framework based on meta reinforcement learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development. At the evolutionary scale, we evolve reservoirs, a family of recurrent neural networks that differ from conventional networks in that one optimizes not the weight values but hyperparameters of the architecture: the later control macro-level properties, such as memory and dynamics. At the developmental scale, we employ these evolved reservoirs to facilitate the learning of a behavioral policy through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Within an RL agent, a reservoir encodes the environment state before providing it to an action policy. We evaluate our approach on several 2D and 3D simulated environments. Our results show that the evolution of reservoirs can improve the learning of diverse challenging tasks. We study in particular three hypotheses: the use of an architecture combining reservoirs and reinforcement learning could enable (1) solving tasks with partial observability, (2) generating oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks, and (3) facilitating the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unknown during the evolution phase.\n\n###### Keywords: \n\nMeta Reinforcement Learning Reservoir Computing Evolutionary Computation \n\n**footnotetext: Equal first authors\u2021\u2021footnotetext: Equal last authors\u2020\u2020footnotetext: Work done as an intern at Flowers and Mnemosyne  \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nAnimals demonstrate remarkable adaptability to their environments, a trait honed through the evolution of their morphological and neural structures [43][28]. Animals are born equipped with both hard-wired behavior routines (e.g. breathing, motor babbling) and learning capabilities to adapt from experience. The costs and benefits of evolving hard-wired behaviors vs. learning capabilities depends on different factors, a central one being the level of unpredictability of environmental conditions across generations [39][15]. Phenotypic traits addressing environmental challenges that are shared across many generations are more likely to evolve hard-wired (e.g. breathing), while traits whose utility can hardly be predicted from its utility in previous generations are likely to be learned through individual development (e.g. learning a specific language). For instance, some hard-wired functions, such as limb babbling supported by central pattern generators (CPGs), might have evolved to generically facilitate the learning of diverse behaviors [22](e.g. CPGs supporting the learning of locomotion, pointing and vocalizations in humans). Another example is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which has been proposed to act as a reservoir of computations: enabling to represent abstractions from inputs within a high-dimensional non-linear space which could be decoded by other areas [21][12].\n\nThis prompts an intriguing question: How can neural structures, optimized at an evolutionary scale, enhance the capabilities of agents to learn complex tasks at a developmental scale? To address this question, we propose to model the interplay between evolution and development as two nested adaptive loops: evolution optimizes the generation of neural structures through natural selection over generations, shaping developmental learning during an agent\u2019s lifetime (Fig.\u00a01). This model agrees with recent views on evolution that emphasize the importance of both loops for the evolution of complex skills [18, 17].\n\nFor this aim, we propose a novel computational approach, called Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning (ER-MRL), integrating mechanisms from Reservoir Computing (RC), Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). We use RL as a model of learning at a developmental scale [27]. In RL, an agent interacts with a simulated environment through actions and observations, receiving rewards according to the task at hand. The objective is to learn an action policy from experience, mapping the observations perceived by the agent to actions in order to maximize cumulative reward over time. The policy is usually modeled as a deep neural network which is iteratively optimized through gradient descent. We use RC as a model of how a genome, encoding macro properties of the agent morphology, can shape the generation of neural structures with rich intrinsic dynamics. In RC, the connection weights of a recurrent neural network (RNN) are generated from global hyperparameters (HPs) controlling macro-level properties of the network related to connectivity, memory and sensitivity. Our choice of using RC relies on its parallels with the biological brain structures discussed earlier. In particular, RC has been proposed as a relevant model of both PFC and CPGs[13][47]. Additionally, because it is a cheap and versatile paradigm, it has demonstrated noteworthy evolutionary properties [36], making it an ideal choice for investigating our research question. In our proposed ER-MRL architecture, the generated neural structure acts as a reservoir of computations, taking as input the sensory-motor activity of the agent, and is connected to the RL action policy.\n\nWe use Meta-RL as a model of how evolution shapes development [8][30]. Meta-RL considers an outer loop, akin to evolution, optimizing HPs of an inner loop, akin to development. At the evolutionary scale (the outer loop), we use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize a genome specifying HPs of reservoirs. At a developmental scale (the inner loop), a RL agent equipped with a generated reservoir learns an action policy to maximize cumulative reward in a simulated environment. Thus, the objective of the outer evolutionary loop is to optimize macro properties of reservoirs in order to facilitate the learning of an action policy in the inner developmental loop.\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: A simplified view of the evolution of brain structures (left) and the parallel with our computational approach (right). We can observe on the left of the figure the interplay between two loops : an evolutionary one that modifies the generating parameters of neural structures, and a developmental one where agents equipped with such neural structures learn to interact with their environment. We propose a computational framework (right) where an evolutionary algorithm optimizes hyperparameters that generate neural structures called reservoirs. These reservoirs are then integrated into RL agents that learn an action policy to maximize their reward in an environment\n\nUsing this computational model, we run experiments in diverse simulated environments, e.g. 2D environments where the agent learns how to balance a pendulum and 3D environments where the agent learns how to control complex morphologies. These experiments provide support to three main hypotheses for how evolved reservoirs can affect intralife learning. First, they can facilitate solving partially-observable tasks, where the agent lacks access to all the information necessary to solve the task. In this case, we test the hypothesis that the recurrent nature of the reservoir will enable learning to infer the unobservable information. Second, it can generate oscillatory dynamics useful for solving locomotion tasks. In this case, the reservoir acts as a meta-learned CPG. Third, it can facilitate the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unknown during the evolution phase. This hypothesis is motivated by the core hypothesis in meta-learning that evolving features of agents at two time-scales leads to the ability of learning to adapt to unknown environments. In our case, our expectation is that HPs of reservoirs evolved across different environments will capture some useful abstract properties for developmental adaptation.\n\nIn Section\u00a02, we detail the methods underlying our proposed model, including RL (Section\u00a02.1), Meta-RL (Section\u00a02.2), RC (Section\u00a02.3), and EAs (Section\u00a02.4). We then explain their integration into the outlined architecture (Section\u00a02.5). Our results, aligned with the three hypotheses, are presented in Section\u00a03. Computational specifics and supplementary experiments can be found in the appendix. The source code is accessible at this link.\n\n##  2 Methods\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: Our proposed architecture, called ER-MRL, integrates several ML paradigms. We consider an RL agent learning an action policy (a), having access to a reservoir (c). We consider two nested adaptive loops in the spirit of Meta-RL (b). Our proposed architecture (d) consists in evolving HPs for the generation of reservoirs in an outer loop. In an inner loop, the agent learns an action policy, that takes as input the neural activation of the reservoir. The policy is trained using RL in order to maximize episodic return. Section\u00a02 provides the computational details of each ML paradigm.  \n\n###  2.1 Reinforcement Learning as a model of development\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) involves an agent that interacts with an environment by taking actions, receiving rewards, and learning an action policy in order to maximize its accumulated rewards (Fig.\u00a02.a). This interaction is formalized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) [31]. An MDP is represented as a tuple , where is the set of possible states of the environment, is the set of available actions to the agent, is the transition function specifying the environment dynamics (how the state at time is determined by the current state and action at time ), represents the initial state distribution, and defines the reward received by the agent for a specific state-action pair. In an episode lasting time steps, the agent observes the environment\u2019s state , takes an action , and receives a reward . The environment then transitions to the next step according to . The objective of RL is to learn a policy that maps observed states to actions in order to maximize the cumulative discounted reward over time, where [41]. The parameter discounts future rewards during decision making, and it\u2019s a key factor in the learning process.\n\nIn Deep RL [19], the policy is implemented as an artificial neural network, whose connection weights are iteratively learned according to the agent\u2019s experience in the environment. In all conducted experiments, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm [35] (see details in Section 5.1.1).\n\n###  2.2 Meta Reinforcement Learning as a model of the interplay between evolution and development\n\nWhile RL has lead to impressive applications [23][37][4], it suffers from several limitations: the learned policy is specific to the task at hand and does not necessarily generalize well to variations of the environment; it learns from scratch and requires a large amount of data to converge. Meta Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) [3] has been proposed to address these issues, where the objective is for an agent to learn how to learn (hence the term meta-learning), i.e. to learn how to quickly adapt to new tasks or environments that were not encountered during the meta learning phase. It is based on two nested adaptive loops : an outer loop, analogous to evolution, optimizes the HPs of an inner loop, analogous to development (Fig.\u00a02.b)[30][29]. The objective of the outer loop is to maximize the average performance of the inner loop on a distribution of environments. Formally, a set of HPs are meta-optimized in the outer loop, with the objective of maximizing the average performance of a population of RL agents conditioned by . In [10], the HPs correspond to the initial weights of a Deep RL policy , those weights being then learned through RL in the inner loop. In [9], instead corresponds to the weights of a RNN, the RNN dynamics itself acting as a learning mechanism in the inner loop. In this paper, we instead propose to leverage the RC framework where corresponds to macro-level properties of a RNN, as explained in the next subsection.\n\n###  2.3 Reservoir computing as a model of neural structure generation\n\nAs noted above, a widely used approach in Meta-RL consists of directly optimizing the weights of a RNN, through backpropagation, in the outer loop. While this technique has demonstrated remarkable efficacy, it is ill-suited for addressing the research question outlined in the introduction for several compelling reasons. Primarily, it lacks biological plausibility, as evolutionary-scale adaptation is unlikely to hinge on backpropagation mechanisms [40]. Additionally, the notion that evolution directly fine-tunes neural network weights contradicts established biological principles. Rather, it is more probable that a genome encodes higher-level properties of neural architectures, leaving the precise instantiation (e.g., connection weights) to morphogenesis during individual development [48] . Within this framework, we choose to optimize recurrent neural networks based on the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm for several reasons outlined in Section\u00a01. This approach aligns with evolutionary and biological principles, as it allows the generation of neural structures from a set of HPs, focusing on macro properties, rather than a direct evolution of neural network weights.\n\nRC [20] emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in training recurrent neural networks. Unlike traditional deep learning, where intensive training is required for the entire network, RC focuses on training only the output layer while keeping the input and recurrent weights randomly fixed. The fundamental idea behind RC is to create a dynamic reservoir of computation from recurrently and randomly connected neurons (called the \"reservoir\"). A random recurrent network plays the role of a \u2019reservoir\u2019 of computations, where inputs are nonlinearly recombined over time, providing a set of dynamic features from which a linear \u2019readout\u2019 is trained: such training is equivalent to selecting and combining interesting features to solve the given task (Fig.\u00a02.c). Several HPs play a crucial role in shaping the efficiency of RC. This includes the number of neurons in the reservoir, the spectral radius , input scaling , and leak rate , that we explain with more detail in Section\u00a05.1.2 in the appendix. In conclusion, RC provides an alternative to deep learning approaches by providing a projection of inputs in \u201crich\u201d high-dimensional dynamics without the need to tune any recurrent weights. This literally provides computations \"on the shelf\" ready to be used, which is an interesting property useful at different stages of evolution. In this paper, we propose to meta-optimize reservoir\u2019s HPs in a Meta-RL outer loop, using evolutionary algorithms explained in the next subsection. We will then explain how we propose to integrate RC with RL in section 2.5.\n\n###  2.4 Evolutionary algorithms as a model of evolution\n\nThe optimization in the outer loop, which can be analogous to evolution, of a Meta RL algorithm can be directly informed by Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) [2]. EAs draws inspiration from the fundamental principles of biological evolution[33], where species improve their fitness through the selection and variation of their genomes. EAs iteratively enhance a population of candidate parameterized solutions to a given optimization problem, iteratively selecting those with higher fitness levels (i.e higher performance of the solution) and mutating their parameters for the next generation.\n\nIn our approach, we utilize the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) [11] as our designated evolutionary algorithm in order to meta-optimize HPs of reservoirs. In CMA-ES, a population of HPs candidates is sampled from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, with mean and covariance matrix . The fitness of each sample of the population is evaluated (see Section\u00a02.5 for how we do it in our proposed method). The Gaussian distribution is then updated by weighting each sample proportionally to its fitness; resulting in a new mean and covariance matrix that are biased toward solutions with higher fitness. This process continues iteratively until either convergence towards sufficiently high fitness values of the generated HPs is achieved, or until a predefined threshold of candidates is reached.\n\n###  2.5 Our method : Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning (EV-MRL)\n\n####  2.5.1 General approach\n\nOur objective is to devise a computational framework to address a fundamental question: How can neural structures adapt at an evolutionary scale, enabling agents to better adapt to their environment at a developmental scale? For this aim, we aim to integrate the Machine Learning paradigms presented above. The architecture is illustrated in Fig.\u00a02.d and the optimization procedure in Fig.\u00a03. We call our method ER-MRL, for \"Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning\". The ER-MRL method encompasses two nested optimization loops (as in Meta-RL, section\u00a02.2). In the outer loop, operating at an evolutionary scale, HPs for generating a reservoir (section\u00a02.3) are optimized using an evolutionary algorithm (section\u00a02.4). In the inner loop, focused on a developmental scale, a RL algorithm (Section\u00a02.1) learns an action policy using the reservoir state as inputs. In other words, the outer loop meta-learns HPs able to generate reservoirs resulting in maximal averages performance on multiple inner loops. The whole process is illustrated in Fig.\u00a03 and detailed below.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 3: In the evolution phase (top), CMA-ES refines Reservoir HPs . At each generation of the evolution loop (left), a population of HPs is sampled from the CMA-ES Gaussian distribution. Each undergoes evaluation on multiple random seeds, generating multiple reservoirs. An ER-MRL agent is created for each reservoir, with its action policy being trained from the states of that reservoir (lighter grey frames). The fitness of a sampled is determined by the average score of all ER-MRL generated from it (mid-grey frames). The fitness values are used to update the CMA-ES distribution for the next generation (dotted arrow). This process iterates until a predetermined threshold is reached. In the Testing phase (bottom), the best set of HPs from all CMA-ES samples is employed. Multiple reservoirs are generated within ER-MRL agents, and their performance is evaluated.  \n\n####  2.5.2 Inner loop\n\nTo represent the development of an agent, we consider a RL agent (Section\u00a02.1) that interacts with an environment through observation , actions and rewards at each time step (Fig.\u00a02.a). In our proposed ER-MRL method, this agent is composed of three main parts : a reservoir generated by HPs (the , the and the refer to Section\u00a05.1.2 for more details), a feed forward action policy network and a RL algorithm. At each time step, we feed the reservoir with the current , and the previous action and reward and (Fig.\u00a02.d). Contrarily to standard RL, our agent does not directly observe the observation of the environment\u2019s state , but the context of the reservoir instead (i.e. the vector of all reservoir\u2019s neurons activations at time ). Because reservoirs are recurrent neural networks, not only encompasses information about the current time step, but also integrates information over previous time steps. We also use ER-MRL with two reservoir. In this case, we still generate the two reservoirs from a set of HPs , and the context given to the agent is the concatenation of both hidden states of the reservoirs. We then train our policy using RL.\n\n####  2.5.3 Outer loop\n\nThe outer loop employs the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES) (Section\u00a02.4) to optimize reservoir HPs . The objective is to generate reservoirs which, on average over multiple agents, improve learning abilities. For each set of HPs, we assess the performance of our agents in multiple inner loops (we utilize 3 in our experiments), each one with a different random seed. Using different random seeds implies that, while using the same HPs set, each agent will be initialized with different connection weights of both their reservoirs, their policies and the initial environment state. Note that while the generated reservoirs have different connection weights, they share the same macro-properties in terms of spectral radius, input scaling and leak rate (since they are generated from the same HPs set). In assessing an agent\u2019s fitness within its RL environment, we compute the mean episodic reward over the final 10 episodes of its training. To obtain the fitness of a reservoir HPs, we calculate the mean fitness of three agents across three different versions of the same environment. These steps are iterated until we reach a predetermined threshold of CMA-ES iterations (set at 900 in our experiments).\n\n####  2.5.4 Evaluation\n\nTo evaluate our method, we select the HPs that generated the best fitness function during the whole outer loop optimization with CMA-ES (see bottom of Fig.\u00a03). We then generate 10 ER-MRL agents with different random seeds (with a different reservoir sampled from for each seed, together with random initial policy weights ) and train the action policy of each agent using RL. We report our results in the next section, comparing the performance of these agents against RL agents using a feedfoward policy.\n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe designed experiments to answer the following hypotheses : The use of an architecture combining reservoirs and RL could enable (1) solving tasks with partial observability, (2) generating oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks, and (3) facilitating the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks unseen during evolution phase.\n\n###  3.1 Evolved reservoirs improve learning in highly partially observable environments \n\nIn this section, we evaluate our approach on tasks with partial observability, where we purposefully remove information from the agent observations. Our hypothesis is that the evolved reservoir can help reconstructing this missing information. Partial observability is an important challenge in the field of RL, where agents have access to only a limited portion of environmental information to make decisions. This is referred to as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [24] rather than a traditional MDP. In this context, the task becomes harder to learn, or even impossible, as the agent needs to make decisions based on an incomplete observation of the environment state. To explore this issue, our experimental framework is based on control environments, such as CartPole, Pendulum, and LunarLander (see details in Fig.\u00a08 of the appendix). We modify these environments by removing velocity-related observations, thus simulating a partially-observable task.\n\nLet\u2019s illustrate this issue with the first environment (CartPole), where the agent\u2019s goal is to keep the pole upright on the cart while it moves laterally. If we remove velocity-related observations (both for the cart and the pole\u2019s angle), a standard feedfoward RL agent cannot effectively solve the task. The reason is straightforward: without this information, the agent doesn\u2019t know the cart\u2019s movement direction or whether the pole is falling or rising. We apply the same process to the other two environments, removing all velocity-related observations for our agents. Can the ER-MRL architecture address this challenge? To find out, we independently evolve reservoirs using ER-MRL for each task. We search for effective HPs tailored to the partial observability of each environment. To evaluate our approach, we compare the performance of ER-MRL agents (equipped with the best reservoir from the evolution phase) on these three partially observable environments against an agent with a feedforward policy. This comparison will determine if reservoir utilization enhances learning in partially observable environments compared to feedfoward RL agents.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 4: Learning curves for partially observable tasks. The x-axis represents the number of timesteps during the training and the y-axis the mean episodic reward. Learning curves of our ER-MRL methods correspond to the testing phase described in the bottom of Fig.\u00a03. Vanilla RL corresponds to a feedforward policy RL agent. The curves and the shaded areas represent the mean and the standard deviation of the reward for 10 random seeds.\n\nFig.\u00a04 presents the results for the three selected partially observable tasks. We observe, as expected, that feedfoward RL agent cannot learn how to solve the task under partial observability (for the reasons mentioned above). In comparison, our approach leads to performance scores close to those obtained by a RL algorithm with full observability. This indicates that the evolved reservoir is able to reconstruct missing information related to velocities from its own internal recurrent dynamics. This confirms the hypothesis that an agent with a reservoir can solve partially observable tasks by using the internal reservoir state to reconstruct some information. We explain with more details why this method could work in Section\u00a05.4.1 of the appendix. The difference in results between the model with 2 reservoirs on LunarLander environment suggests that solving it requires encoding at least two different timescales dynamics. Our interpretation here is that solving LunarLander requires to deal with both an \"approaching\" and \"landing\" phase, unlike the two other environments.\n\n###  3.2 Evolved reservoirs could generate oscillatory dynamics that facilitate the learning of locomotion tasks\n\nIn this section, we evaluate our approach on agents with 3D morphology having to learn locomotion tasks shown in Fig.\u00a09We postulate that the integration of an evolved reservoir can engender oscillatory patterns that aid in coordinating body movements, akin to Central Pattern Generators (CPGs). CPGs, rooted in neurobiology, denote an interconnected network of neurons responsible for generating intricate and repetitive rhythmic patterns that govern movements or behaviors [22] such as walking, swimming, or other cyclical movements. Existing scientific literature hypothesizes that reservoirs, possessing significant rhythmic components, share direct connections with CPGs [34]. We propose to study this hypothesis using motor tasks involving rhythmic movements. We employed 3D MuJoCo environments (detailed in Fig.\u00a09 of the appendix), where the goal is to exert forces on various rotors of creatures to propel them forward. Notably, while the ultimate goal across these tasks remains constant (forward movement), the creatures exhibit diverse morphologies, including humanoids, insects, worms, bipeds, and more. Furthermore, the action and observation spaces vary for each morphology. We individually evaluate our ER-MRL architecture on each of these tasks.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] Figure 5: Learning curves for locomotion tasks. Same conventions as Fig.\u00a04\n\nOur approach demonstrates improved performance in some tasks (Ant, HalfCheetah, and Swimmer) compared to a standard RL baseline, particularly noticeable in the early stages of learning, as illustrated in Figure 5. This suggests that the evolved reservoir may generate beneficial oscillatory patterns, facilitating the learning of locomotion tasks, in line with the notion that reservoirs could potentially function as CPGs, aiding in solving motor tasks. Although carefully testing this hypotheses would require more analysis, we present in Section\u00a05.4.2 in the appendix preliminary data suggesting that the evolved reservoir is able to generate oscillatory dynamics that could facilitate learning in the Swimmer environment. However, as shown in Fig.\u00a05, performance enhancement was not observed in the Walker and Hopper environments compared to the RL baseline. Locomotion in both environments demands precise closed-loop control strategies to maintain an agent\u2019s equilibrium. In such cases, generated oscillatory patterns may not be as beneficial.\n\n###  3.3 Evolved reservoirs improve generalization on new tasks unseen during evolution phase\n\nIn this section, we address a key aspect of our study: the ability of evolved reservoirs to facilitate adaptation to novel environments. This inquiry is crucial in assessing the potential of evolved neural structures to generalize and enhance an agent\u2019s adaptability beyond the evolution phase. Building on the promising results of ER-MRL with two reservoirs in previous experiments, we focus exclusively on this configuration for comparison with the RL baseline.\n\n####  3.3.1 Generalizing across different morphologies with similar tasks\n\nIn prior experiments, ER-MRL demonstrated effectiveness in environments like Ant, HalfCheetah, and Swimmer. This success led us to explore whether reservoirs evolved for two of these tasks could be adaptable to the third, indicating potential generalization across different morphologies. However, due to variations in environments, including differences in morphology, observation and action spaces, and reward fun\nVisible: 0% - 48%", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "open_url", "args": ["https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06695"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "37d50b22-da01-44c7-8e18-c557e7a1e4c6", "request_id": "8513e86b88d66f15-CDG", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "37d50b22-da01-44c7-8e18-c557e7a1e4c6", "children": ["f63535a3-e08f-453c-a3fd-17f012a07291"]}, "f63535a3-e08f-453c-a3fd-17f012a07291": {"id": "f63535a3-e08f-453c-a3fd-17f012a07291", "message": {"id": "f63535a3-e08f-453c-a3fd-17f012a07291", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1707227920.484794, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["The paper \"Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning\" explores how evolving reservoirs within a meta reinforcement learning framework can enhance learning and adaptation.

Many of these models store considerable data on the tasks and achieve high performance by\nextracting visual and time-series features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks respec-\ntively. However, these networks have very high computational costs because they need to be trained by repeatedly using the\nstored data. In this study, we propose a novel practical approach called reinforcement learning with a convolutional reservoir\ncomputing (RCRC) model. The RCRC model uses a fixed random-weight CNN and a reservoir computing model to extract\nvisual and time-series features. Using these extracted features, it decides actions with an evolution strategy method. Thereby, the\nRCRC model has several desirable features: (1) there is no need to train the feature extractor, (2) there is no need to store training\ndata, (3) it can take a wide range of actions, and (4) there is only a single task-dependent weight matrix to be trained. Furthermore,\nwe show the RCRC model can solve multiple reinforcement learning tasks with a completely identical feature extractor\n\nand here the conclusion :\n\nIn this study, we focused on extracting features that sufficient-\nly express the environment state, rather than those that are\ntrained to get higher rewards. To this end, we developed a\nnovel approach called RCRC model which using fixed\nrandom-weight CNN and a novel ESN-based method, respec-\ntively, extracts visual features from environment state images\nand time-series features from transitions of visual features.\nThis model architecture results in highly practical features that\nomit the training process of the feature extractor and reduce\ncomputational costs, and there is no need to store large vol-\numes of data. Surprisingly, extracted features are expressive\nenough to solve multiple RL tasks with training only a linear\ntransformation of those features, despite the fact that it used\nthe completely identical feature extractor. These results bring\nus to the conclusion that network structures themselves, such\nas CNN and ESN, have the capacity to extract features, and\nthe RCRC model has generalization ability to express various\nenvironments and solve RL tasks.\n\n\n but please, do ass I say : precise that the usage of can looks like the extraction of features that can be done with wavelet transform (or debuchy).

Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama\u00a02\u00a070B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama\u00a02\u00a070B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.   \n\nCode: \u30100\u2020https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src\u2020github.com\u3011   \nWebpage: \u30101\u2020https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\u2020mistral.ai\u3011\n\n [Image 0: [Uncaptioned image]] \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral\u00a08x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As it only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low batch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\n\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the \u201cexperts\u201d) to process the token and combine their output additively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\n\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\n\nWe also present Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization\u00a0[\u30102\u202025\u3011]. Its performance notably surpasses that of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u2013 chat model on human evaluation benchmarks. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD.\n\nWe release both Mixtral\u00a08x7B and Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license^{1}^{1}1\u30101\u2020https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\u2020mistral.ai\u3011, free for academic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications. To enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to the vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference. Skypilot also allows the deployment of vLLM endpoints on any instance in the cloud.\n\n##  2 Architectural details\n\n   Parameter Value  \n dim  \n n_layers  \n head_dim  \n hidden_dim  \n n_heads  \n n_kv_heads  \n context_len  \n vocab_size  \n num_experts  \n top_k_experts  \n\n Table 1: Model architecture.\n\nMixtral is based on a transformer architecture\u00a0[\u30103\u202031\u3011] and uses the same modifications as described in [\u30104\u202018\u3011], with the notable exceptions that Mixtral supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens, and the feedforward blocks are replaced by Mixture-of-Expert layers (Section\u00a0\u30105\u20202.1\u3011). The model architecture parameters are summarized in Table\u00a0\u30106\u20201\u3011.\n\n###  2.1 Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The layer\u2019s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard feedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture. \n\nWe present a brief overview of the Mixture of Experts layer (Figure\u00a01). For a more in-depth overview, see [\u30107\u202012\u3011]. The output of the MoE module for a given input is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs of the expert networks, where the weights are given by the gating network\u2019s output. i.e. given expert networks , the output of the expert layer is given by:\n\nHere, denotes the -dimensional output of the gating network for the -th expert, and is the output of the -th expert network. If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing the outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing \u00a0[\u30108\u20206\u3011, \u30109\u202015\u3011, \u301010\u202035\u3011], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the Top-K logits of a linear layer\u00a0[\u301011\u202028\u3011]. We use\n\nwhere if is among the top-K coordinates of logits and otherwise. The value of K \u2013 the number of experts used per token \u2013 is a hyper-parameter that modulates the amount of compute used to process each token. If one increases while keeping fixed, one can increase the model\u2019s parameter count while keeping its computational cost effectively constant. This motivates a distinction between the model\u2019s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the sparse parameter count), which grows with , and the number of parameters used for processing an individual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with up to .\n\nMoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For example, Megablocks\u00a0[\u301012\u202013\u3011] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large sparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling cases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the MoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and through a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP)\u00a0[\u301011\u202028\u3011]. During the MoE layer\u2019s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding GPU for processing, and the expert\u2019s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP introduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks.\n\nIn a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the feed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU architecture as the expert function and set . This means each token is routed to two SwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output for an input token is computed as:\n\nThis formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [\u301013\u202021\u3011], with the exceptions that we replace all FFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a more elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token.\n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe compare Mixtral to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison. We measure performance on a wide variety of tasks categorized as follow:\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 2:  Performance of Mixtral and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks. All models were re-evaluated on all metrics with our evaluation pipeline for accurate comparison. Mixtral outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks.

Figure\u00a02 compares the performance of Mixtral with the Llama models in different categories. Mixtral surpasses Llama 2 70B across most metrics. In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 3:  Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension, math and code for Mistral (7B/8x7B) vs Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mixtral largely outperforms Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks, except on reading comprehension benchmarks while using 5x lower active parameters. It is also vastly superior to Llama 2 70B on code and math. \n\nSize and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral models\u2019 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure\u00a03). As a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories.\n\nNote that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section\u00a0\u30105\u20202.1\u3011), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization. The memory costs for serving Mixtral are proportional to its sparse parameter count, 47B, which is still smaller than Llama 2 70B. As for device utilization, we note that the SMoEs layer introduces additional overhead due to the routing mechanism and due to the increased memory loads when running more than one expert per device. They are more suitable for batched workloads where one can reach a good degree of arithmetic intensity.\n\nComparison with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. In Table\u00a0\u301033\u20203\u3011, we report the performance of Mixtral\u00a08x7B compared to Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. We observe that Mixtral performs similarly or above the two other models. On MMLU, Mixtral obtains a better performance, despite its significantly smaller capacity (47B tokens compared to 70B). For MT Bench, we report the performance of the latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model available, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n\nEvaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\n\n     LLaMA 2 70B GPT-3.5 Mixtral\u00a08x7B  \n    MMLU  \n (MCQ in 57 subjects)  \n69.9% 70.0% 70.6%  \n    HellaSwag  \n (10-shot)  \n 87.1% 85.5% 86.7%  \n    ARC Challenge  \n (25-shot)  \n85.1% 85.2% 85.8%  \n    WinoGrande  \n (5-shot)  \n83.2% 81.6% 81.2%  \n    MBPP  \n (pass@1)  \n49.8% 52.2% 60.7%  \n    GSM-8K  \n (5-shot)  \n53.6% 57.1% 58.4%  \n    MT Bench  \n (for Instruct Models)  \n6.86 8.32 8.30  \nTable 3: Comparison of Mixtral with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5.

The extra capacity allows Mixtral to perform well on multilingual benchmarks while maintaining a high accuracy in English. In particular, Mixtral significantly outperforms Llama 2 70B in French, German, Spanish, and Italian, as shown in Table\u00a0\u301034\u20204\u3011.\n\n        Active  Params French German Spanish Italian  \n Model Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU  \n LLaMA 1 33B 33B 39.3% 68.1% 49.9% 41.1% 63.3% 48.7% 45.7% 69.8% 52.3% 42.9% 65.4% 49.0%  \n LLaMA 2 70B 70B 49.9% 72.5% 64.3% 47.3% 68.7% 64.2% 50.5% 74.5% 66.0% 49.4% 70.9% 65.1%  \n Mixtral\u00a08x7B 13B 58.2% 77.4% 70.9% 54.3% 73.0% 71.5% 55.4% 77.6% 72.5% 52.8% 75.1% 70.9%  \nTable 4:  Comparison of Mixtral with Llama on Multilingual Benchmarks.

Results in Figure\u00a0\u301036\u20204\u3011 (Left) show that Mixtral achieves a 100% retrieval accuracy regardless of the context length or the position of passkey in the sequence. Figure\u00a0\u301036\u20204\u3011 (Right) shows that the perplexity of Mixtral on a subset of the proof-pile dataset\u00a0[\u301037\u20202\u3011] decreases monotonically as the size of the context increases.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption]\n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 4: Long range performance of Mixtral. (Left) Mixtral has 100% retrieval accuracy of the Passkey task regardless of the location of the passkey and length of the input sequence.

Compared Llama 2 70B, Mixtral presents less bias (higher accuracy on BBQ, lower std on BOLD) and displays more positive sentiment (higher avg on BOLD).\n\n###  3.3 Bias Benchmarks\n\nTo identify possible flaws to be corrected by fine-tuning / preference modeling, we measure the base model performance on Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)\u00a0[\u301038\u202024\u3011] and Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD)\u00a0[\u301039\u202010\u3011]. BBQ is a dataset of hand-written question sets that target attested social biases against nine different socially-relevant categories: age, disability status, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation. BOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains.\n\nWe benchmark Llama 2 and Mixtral on BBQ and BOLD with our evaluation framework and report the results in Table\u00a0\u301040\u20205\u3011. Compared to Llama 2, Mixtral presents less bias on the BBQ benchmark (56.0% vs 51.5%). For each group in BOLD, a higher average sentiment score means more positive sentiments and a lower standard deviation indicates less bias within the group. Overall, Mixtral displays more positive sentiments than Llama 2, with similar variances within each group.\n\n##  4 Instruction Fine-tuning\n\nWe train Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an instruction dataset followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\u00a0[\u30102\u202025\u3011] on a paired feedback dataset. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct reaches a score of 8.30 on MT-Bench\u00a0[\u301041\u202033\u3011] (see Table\u00a0\u301032\u20202\u3011), making it the best open-weights model as of December 2023. Independent human evaluation conducted by LMSys is reported in Figure\u00a06^{3}^{3}3\u301042\u2020https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\u2020huggingface.co\u3011 and shows that Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini Pro, Claude-2.1, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B chat.\n\n[Image 6: Refer to caption] Figure 6:  LMSys Leaderboard. (Screenshot from Dec 22, 2023) Mixtral\u00a08x7B Instruct v0.1 achieves an Arena Elo rating of 1121 outperforming Claude-2.1 (1117), all versions of GPT-3.5-Turbo (1117 best), Gemini Pro (1111), and Llama-2-70b-chat (1077). Mixtral is currently the best open-weights model by a large margin.   \n\n##  5 Routing analysis\n\nIn this section, we perform a small analysis on the expert selection by the router. In particular, we are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g. mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.).\n\nTo investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile validation dataset\u00a0[\u301043\u202014\u3011]. Results are presented in Figure\u00a07, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31 respectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious patterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of expert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts), and for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents.\n\nOnly for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is likely a consequence of the dataset\u2019s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language spectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very correlated to the input and output embeddings respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure\u00a08 shows examples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token is highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that words such as \u2018self\u2019 in Python and \u2018Question\u2019 in English often get routed through the same expert even though they involve multiple tokens. Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always assigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more correlated to the input and output of the model.\n\nWe also note from Figure\u00a08 that consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts. In fact, we observe some degree of positional locality in The Pile datasets. Table\u00a0\u301044\u20205\u3011 shows the proportion of consecutive tokens that get the same expert assignments per domain and layer. The proportion of repeated\n\n[Image 7: Refer to caption] Figure 7:  Proportion of tokens assigned to each expert on different domains from The Pile dataset for layers 0, 15, and 31. The gray dashed vertical line marks , i.e. the proportion expected with uniform sampling. Here, we consider experts that are either selected as a first or second choice by the router. A breakdown of the proportion of assignments done in each case cane be seen in Figure\u00a09 in the Appendix. \n\nconsecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications in how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high locality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism. Conversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [\u301045\u202011\u3011].

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral\u00a07B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama\u00a02\u00a070B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama\u00a02\u00a070B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.   \n\nCode: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src   \nWebpage: https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\n\n [Image 0: [Uncaptioned image]] \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral\u00a08x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As it only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low batch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\n\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the \u201cexperts\u201d) to process the token and combine their output additively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\n\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\n\nWe also present Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization\u00a0[25]. Its performance notably surpasses that of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u2013 chat model on human evaluation benchmarks. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD.\n\nWe release both Mixtral\u00a08x7B and Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license^{1}^{1}1https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/, free for academic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications. To enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to the vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference. Skypilot also allows the deployment of vLLM endpoints on any instance in the cloud.\n\n##  2 Architectural details\n\n   Parameter Value  \n dim  \n n_layers  \n head_dim  \n hidden_dim  \n n_heads  \n n_kv_heads  \n context_len  \n vocab_size  \n num_experts  \n top_k_experts  \n\n Table 1: Model architecture.\n\nMixtral is based on a transformer architecture\u00a0[31] and uses the same modifications as described in [18], with the notable exceptions that Mixtral supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens, and the feedforward blocks are replaced by Mixture-of-Expert layers (Section\u00a02.1). The model architecture parameters are summarized in Table\u00a01.\n\n###  2.1 Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The layer\u2019s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard feedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture. \n\nWe present a brief overview of the Mixture of Experts layer (Figure\u00a01). For a more in-depth overview, see [12]. The output of the MoE module for a given input is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs of the expert networks, where the weights are given by the gating network\u2019s output. i.e. given expert networks , the output of the expert layer is given by:\n\nHere, denotes the -dimensional output of the gating network for the -th expert, and is the output of the -th expert network. If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing the outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing \u00a0[6, 15, 35], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the Top-K logits of a linear layer\u00a0[28]. We use\n\nwhere if is among the top-K coordinates of logits and otherwise. The value of K \u2013 the number of experts used per token \u2013 is a hyper-parameter that modulates the amount of compute used to process each token. If one increases while keeping fixed, one can increase the model\u2019s parameter count while keeping its computational cost effectively constant. This motivates a distinction between the model\u2019s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the sparse parameter count), which grows with , and the number of parameters used for processing an individual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with up to .\n\nMoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For example, Megablocks\u00a0[13] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large sparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling cases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the MoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and through a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP)\u00a0[28]. During the MoE layer\u2019s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding GPU for processing, and the expert\u2019s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP introduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks.\n\nIn a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the feed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU architecture as the expert function and set . This means each token is routed to two SwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output for an input token is computed as:\n\nThis formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [21], with the exceptions that we replace all FFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a more elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token.\n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe compare Mixtral to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison. We measure performance on a wide variety of tasks categorized as follow:\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 2:  Performance of Mixtral and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks.

Figure\u00a02 compares the performance of Mixtral with the Llama models in different categories. Mixtral surpasses Llama 2 70B across most metrics. In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 3:  Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension, math and code for Mistral (7B/8x7B) vs Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mixtral largely outperforms Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks, except on reading comprehension benchmarks while using 5x lower active parameters. It is also vastly superior to Llama 2 70B on code and math. \n\nSize and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral models\u2019 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure\u00a03). As a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories.\n\nNote that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section\u00a02.1), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization. The memory costs for serving Mixtral are proportional to its sparse parameter count, 47B, which is still smaller than Llama 2 70B. As for device utilization, we note that the SMoEs layer introduces additional overhead due to the routing mechanism and due to the increased memory loads when running more than one expert per device. They are more suitable for batched workloads where one can reach a good degree of arithmetic intensity.\n\nComparison with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. In Table\u00a03, we report the performance of Mixtral\u00a08x7B compared to Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. We observe that Mixtral performs similarly or above the two other models. On MMLU, Mixtral obtains a better performance, despite its significantly smaller capacity (47B tokens compared to 70B). For MT Bench, we report the performance of the latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model available, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n\nEvaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\n\n     LLaMA 2 70B GPT-3.5 Mixtral\u00a08x7B  \n    MMLU  \n (MCQ in 57 subjects)  \n69.9% 70.0% 70.6%  \n    HellaSwag  \n (10-shot)  \n 87.1% 85.5% 86.7%  \n    ARC Challenge  \n (25-shot)  \n85.1% 85.2% 85.8%  \n    WinoGrande  \n (5-shot)  \n83.2% 81.6% 81.2%  \n    MBPP  \n (pass@1)  \n49.8% 52.2% 60.7%  \n    GSM-8K  \n (5-shot)  \n53.6% 57.1% 58.4%  \n    MT Bench  \n (for Instruct Models)  \n6.86 8.32 8.30  \nTable 3: Comparison of Mixtral with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5.

The extra capacity allows Mixtral to perform well on multilingual benchmarks while maintaining a high accuracy in English. In particular, Mixtral significantly outperforms Llama 2 70B in French, German, Spanish, and Italian, as shown in Table\u00a04.\n\n        Active  Params French German Spanish Italian  \n Model Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU  \n LLaMA 1 33B 33B 39.3% 68.1% 49.9% 41.1% 63.3% 48.7% 45.7% 69.8% 52.3% 42.9% 65.4% 49.0%  \n LLaMA 2 70B 70B 49.9% 72.5% 64.3% 47.3% 68.7% 64.2% 50.5% 74.5% 66.0% 49.4% 70.9% 65.1%  \n Mixtral\u00a08x7B 13B 58.2% 77.4% 70.9% 54.3% 73.0% 71.5% 55.4% 77.6% 72.5% 52.8% 75.1% 70.9%  \nTable 4:  Comparison of Mixtral with Llama on Multilingual Benchmarks.

Results in Figure\u00a04 (Left) show that Mixtral achieves a 100% retrieval accuracy regardless of the context length or the position of passkey in the sequence. Figure\u00a04 (Right) shows that the perplexity of Mixtral on a subset of the proof-pile dataset\u00a0[2] decreases monotonically as the size of the context increases.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption]\n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 4: Long range performance of Mixtral. (Left) Mixtral has 100% retrieval accuracy of the Passkey task regardless of the location of the passkey and length of the input sequence.

Compared Llama 2 70B, Mixtral presents less bias (higher accuracy on BBQ, lower std on BOLD) and displays more positive sentiment (higher avg on BOLD).\n\n###  3.3 Bias Benchmarks\n\nTo identify possible flaws to be corrected by fine-tuning / preference modeling, we measure the base model performance on Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)\u00a0[24] and Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD)\u00a0[10]. BBQ is a dataset of hand-written question sets that target attested social biases against nine different socially-relevant categories: age, disability status, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation. BOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains.\n\nWe benchmark Llama 2 and Mixtral on BBQ and BOLD with our evaluation framework and report the results in Table\u00a05. Compared to Llama 2, Mixtral presents less bias on the BBQ benchmark (56.0% vs 51.5%). For each group in BOLD, a higher average sentiment score means more positive sentiments and a lower standard deviation indicates less bias within the group. Overall, Mixtral displays more positive sentiments than Llama 2, with similar variances within each group.\n\n##  4 Instruction Fine-tuning\n\nWe train Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an instruction dataset followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\u00a0[25] on a paired feedback dataset. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct reaches a score of 8.30 on MT-Bench\u00a0[33] (see Table\u00a02), making it the best open-weights model as of December 2023. Independent human evaluation conducted by LMSys is reported in Figure\u00a06^{3}^{3}3https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard and shows that Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini Pro, Claude-2.1, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B chat.\n\n[Image 6: Refer to caption] Figure 6:  LMSys Leaderboard. (Screenshot from Dec 22, 2023) Mixtral\u00a08x7B Instruct v0.1 achieves an Arena Elo rating of 1121 outperforming Claude-2.1 (1117), all versions of GPT-3.5-Turbo (1117 best), Gemini Pro (1111), and Llama-2-70b-chat (1077). Mixtral is currently the best open-weights model by a large margin.   \n\n##  5 Routing analysis\n\nIn this section, we perform a small analysis on the expert selection by the router. In particular, we are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g. mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.).\n\nTo investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile validation dataset\u00a0[14]. Results are presented in Figure\u00a07, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31 respectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious patterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of expert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts), and for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents.\n\nOnly for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is likely a consequence of the dataset\u2019s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language spectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very correlated to the input and output embeddings respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure\u00a08 shows examples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token is highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that words such as \u2018self\u2019 in Python and \u2018Question\u2019 in English often get routed through the same expert even though they involve multiple tokens. Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always assigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more correlated to the input and output of the model.\n\nWe also note from Figure\u00a08 that consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts. In fact, we observe some degree of positional locality in The Pile datasets. Table\u00a05 shows the proportion of consecutive tokens that get the same expert assignments per domain and layer. The proportion of repeated\n\n[Image 7: Refer to caption] Figure 7:  Proportion of tokens assigned to each expert on different domains from The Pile dataset for layers 0, 15, and 31. The gray dashed vertical line marks , i.e. the proportion expected with uniform sampling. Here, we consider experts that are either selected as a first or second choice by the router. A breakdown of the proportion of assignments done in each case cane be seen in Figure\u00a09 in the Appendix. \n\nconsecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications in how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high locality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism. Conversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [11].

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral\u00a07B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama\u00a02\u00a070B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama\u00a02\u00a070B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.   \n\nCode: \u30100\u2020https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src\u2020github.com\u3011   \nWebpage: \u30101\u2020https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\u2020mistral.ai\u3011\n\n [Image 0: [Uncaptioned image]] \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral\u00a08x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As it only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low batch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\n\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the \u201cexperts\u201d) to process the token and combine their output additively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\n\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\n\nWe also present Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization\u00a0[\u30102\u202025\u3011]. Its performance notably surpasses that of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u2013 chat model on human evaluation benchmarks. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD.\n\nWe release both Mixtral\u00a08x7B and Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license^{1}^{1}1\u30101\u2020https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\u2020mistral.ai\u3011, free for academic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications. To enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to the vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference. Skypilot also allows the deployment of vLLM endpoints on any instance in the cloud.\n\n##  2 Architectural details\n\n   Parameter Value  \n dim  \n n_layers  \n head_dim  \n hidden_dim  \n n_heads  \n n_kv_heads  \n context_len  \n vocab_size  \n num_experts  \n top_k_experts  \n\n Table 1: Model architecture.\n\nMixtral is based on a transformer architecture\u00a0[\u30103\u202031\u3011] and uses the same modifications as described in [\u30104\u202018\u3011], with the notable exceptions that Mixtral supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens, and the feedforward blocks are replaced by Mixture-of-Expert layers (Section\u00a0\u30105\u20202.1\u3011). The model architecture parameters are summarized in Table\u00a0\u30106\u20201\u3011.\n\n###  2.1 Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The layer\u2019s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard feedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture. \n\nWe present a brief overview of the Mixture of Experts layer (Figure\u00a01). For a more in-depth overview, see [\u30107\u202012\u3011]. The output of the MoE module for a given input is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs of the expert networks, where the weights are given by the gating network\u2019s output. i.e. given expert networks , the output of the expert layer is given by:\n\nHere, denotes the -dimensional output of the gating network for the -th expert, and is the output of the -th expert network. If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing the outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing \u00a0[\u30108\u20206\u3011, \u30109\u202015\u3011, \u301010\u202035\u3011], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the Top-K logits of a linear layer\u00a0[\u301011\u202028\u3011]. We use\n\nwhere if is among the top-K coordinates of logits and otherwise. The value of K \u2013 the number of experts used per token \u2013 is a hyper-parameter that modulates the amount of compute used to process each token. If one increases while keeping fixed, one can increase the model\u2019s parameter count while keeping its computational cost effectively constant. This motivates a distinction between the model\u2019s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the sparse parameter count), which grows with , and the number of parameters used for processing an individual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with up to .\n\nMoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For example, Megablocks\u00a0[\u301012\u202013\u3011] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large sparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling cases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the MoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and through a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP)\u00a0[\u301011\u202028\u3011]. During the MoE layer\u2019s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding GPU for processing, and the expert\u2019s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP introduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks.\n\nIn a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the feed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU architecture as the expert function and set . This means each token is routed to two SwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output for an input token is computed as:\n\nThis formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [\u301013\u202021\u3011], with the exceptions that we replace all FFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a more elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token.\n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe compare Mixtral to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison. We measure performance on a wide variety of tasks categorized as follow:\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 2:  Performance of Mixtral and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks.

Figure\u00a02 compares the performance of Mixtral with the Llama models in different categories. Mixtral surpasses Llama 2 70B across most metrics. In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 3:  Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension, math and code for Mistral (7B/8x7B) vs Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mixtral largely outperforms Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks, except on reading comprehension benchmarks while using 5x lower active parameters. It is also vastly superior to Llama 2 70B on code and math. \n\nSize and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral models\u2019 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure\u00a03). As a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories.\n\nNote that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section\u00a0\u30105\u20202.1\u3011), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization. The memory costs for serving Mixtral are proportional to its sparse parameter count, 47B, which is still smaller than Llama 2 70B. As for device utilization, we note that the SMoEs layer introduces additional overhead due to the routing mechanism and due to the increased memory loads when running more than one expert per device. They are more suitable for batched workloads where one can reach a good degree of arithmetic intensity.\n\nComparison with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. In Table\u00a0\u301033\u20203\u3011, we report the performance of Mixtral\u00a08x7B compared to Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. We observe that Mixtral performs similarly or above the two other models. On MMLU, Mixtral obtains a better performance, despite its significantly smaller capacity (47B tokens compared to 70B). For MT Bench, we report the performance of the latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model available, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n\nEvaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\n\n     LLaMA 2 70B GPT-3.5 Mixtral\u00a08x7B  \n    MMLU  \n (MCQ in 57 subjects)  \n69.9% 70.0% 70.6%  \n    HellaSwag  \n (10-shot)  \n 87.1% 85.5% 86.7%  \n    ARC Challenge  \n (25-shot)  \n85.1% 85.2% 85.8%  \n    WinoGrande  \n (5-shot)  \n83.2% 81.6% 81.2%  \n    MBPP  \n (pass@1)  \n49.8% 52.2% 60.7%  \n    GSM-8K  \n (5-shot)  \n53.6% 57.1% 58.4%  \n    MT Bench  \n (for Instruct Models)  \n6.86 8.32 8.30  \nTable 3: Comparison of Mixtral with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5.

The extra capacity allows Mixtral to perform well on multilingual benchmarks while maintaining a high accuracy in English. In particular, Mixtral significantly outperforms Llama 2 70B in French, German, Spanish, and Italian, as shown in Table\u00a0\u301034\u20204\u3011.\n\n        Active  Params French German Spanish Italian  \n Model Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU  \n LLaMA 1 33B 33B 39.3% 68.1% 49.9% 41.1% 63.3% 48.7% 45.7% 69.8% 52.3% 42.9% 65.4% 49.0%  \n LLaMA 2 70B 70B 49.9% 72.5% 64.3% 47.3% 68.7% 64.2% 50.5% 74.5% 66.0% 49.4% 70.9% 65.1%  \n Mixtral\u00a08x7B 13B 58.2% 77.4% 70.9% 54.3% 73.0% 71.5% 55.4% 77.6% 72.5% 52.8% 75.1% 70.9%  \nTable 4:  Comparison of Mixtral with Llama on Multilingual Benchmarks.

Results in Figure\u00a0\u301036\u20204\u3011 (Left) show that Mixtral achieves a 100% retrieval accuracy regardless of the context length or the position of passkey in the sequence. Figure\u00a0\u301036\u20204\u3011 (Right) shows that the perplexity of Mixtral on a subset of the proof-pile dataset\u00a0[\u301037\u20202\u3011] decreases monotonically as the size of the context increases.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption]\n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 4: Long range performance of Mixtral. (Left) Mixtral has 100% retrieval accuracy of the Passkey task regardless of the location of the passkey and length of the input sequence.

Compared Llama 2 70B, Mixtral presents less bias (higher accuracy on BBQ, lower std on BOLD) and displays more positive sentiment (higher avg on BOLD).\n\n###  3.3 Bias Benchmarks\n\nTo identify possible flaws to be corrected by fine-tuning / preference modeling, we measure the base model performance on Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)\u00a0[\u301038\u202024\u3011] and Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD)\u00a0[\u301039\u202010\u3011]. BBQ is a dataset of hand-written question sets that target attested social biases against nine different socially-relevant categories: age, disability status, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation. BOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains.\n\nWe benchmark Llama 2 and Mixtral on BBQ and BOLD with our evaluation framework and report the results in Table\u00a0\u301040\u20205\u3011. Compared to Llama 2, Mixtral presents less bias on the BBQ benchmark (56.0% vs 51.5%). For each group in BOLD, a higher average sentiment score means more positive sentiments and a lower standard deviation indicates less bias within the group. Overall, Mixtral displays more positive sentiments than Llama 2, with similar variances within each group.\n\n##  4 Instruction Fine-tuning\n\nWe train Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an instruction dataset followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\u00a0[\u30102\u202025\u3011] on a paired feedback dataset. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct reaches a score of 8.30 on MT-Bench\u00a0[\u301041\u202033\u3011] (see Table\u00a0\u301032\u20202\u3011), making it the best open-weights model as of December 2023. Independent human evaluation conducted by LMSys is reported in Figure\u00a06^{3}^{3}3\u301042\u2020https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard\u2020huggingface.co\u3011 and shows that Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini Pro, Claude-2.1, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B chat.\n\n[Image 6: Refer to caption] Figure 6:  LMSys Leaderboard. (Screenshot from Dec 22, 2023) Mixtral\u00a08x7B Instruct v0.1 achieves an Arena Elo rating of 1121 outperforming Claude-2.1 (1117), all versions of GPT-3.5-Turbo (1117 best), Gemini Pro (1111), and Llama-2-70b-chat (1077). Mixtral is currently the best open-weights model by a large margin.   \n\n##  5 Routing analysis\n\nIn this section, we perform a small analysis on the expert selection by the router. In particular, we are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g. mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.).\n\nTo investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile validation dataset\u00a0[\u301043\u202014\u3011]. Results are presented in Figure\u00a07, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31 respectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious patterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of expert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts), and for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents.\n\nOnly for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is likely a consequence of the dataset\u2019s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language spectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very correlated to the input and output embeddings respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure\u00a08 shows examples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token is highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that words such as \u2018self\u2019 in Python and \u2018Question\u2019 in English often get routed through the same expert even though they involve multiple tokens. Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always assigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more correlated to the input and output of the model.\n\nWe also note from Figure\u00a08 that consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts. In fact, we observe some degree of positional locality in The Pile datasets. Table\u00a0\u301044\u20205\u3011 shows the proportion of consecutive tokens that get the same expert assignments per domain and layer. The proportion of repeated\n\n[Image 7: Refer to caption] Figure 7:  Proportion of tokens assigned to each expert on different domains from The Pile dataset for layers 0, 15, and 31. The gray dashed vertical line marks , i.e. the proportion expected with uniform sampling. Here, we consider experts that are either selected as a first or second choice by the router. A breakdown of the proportion of assignments done in each case cane be seen in Figure\u00a09 in the Appendix. \n\nconsecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications in how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high locality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism. Conversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [\u301045\u202011\u3011]. A more complete view of these same expert frequency is provided for all layers and across datasets in Figure\u00a010 in the Appendix.\n\n[Image 8: Refer to caption] Figure 8: Text samples where each token is colored with the first expert choice. The selection of experts appears to be more aligned with the syntax rather than the domain, especially at the initial and final layers.

Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral\u00a07B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama\u00a02\u00a070B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama\u00a02\u00a070B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0chat model on human benchmarks. Both the base and instruct models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.   \n\nCode: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src   \nWebpage: https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/\n\n [Image 0: [Uncaptioned image]] \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nIn this paper, we present Mixtral\u00a08x7B, a sparse mixture of experts model (SMoE) with open weights, licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 on most benchmarks. As it only uses a subset of its parameters for every token, Mixtral allows faster inference speed at low batch-sizes, and higher throughput at large batch-sizes.\n\nMixtral is a sparse mixture-of-experts network. It is a decoder-only model where the feedforward block picks from a set of 8 distinct groups of parameters. At every layer, for every token, a router network chooses two of these groups (the \u201cexperts\u201d) to process the token and combine their output additively. This technique increases the number of parameters of a model while controlling cost and latency, as the model only uses a fraction of the total set of parameters per token.\n\nMixtral is pretrained with multilingual data using a context size of 32k tokens. It either matches or exceeds the performance of Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5, over several benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral demonstrates superior capabilities in mathematics, code generation, and tasks that require multilingual understanding, significantly outperforming Llama 2 70B in these domains. Experiments show that Mixtral is able to successfully retrieve information from its context window of 32k tokens, regardless of the sequence length and the location of the information in the sequence.\n\nWe also present Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, a chat model fine-tuned to follow instructions using supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization\u00a0[25]. Its performance notably surpasses that of GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B \u2013 chat model on human evaluation benchmarks. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct also demonstrates reduced biases, and a more balanced sentiment profile in benchmarks such as BBQ, and BOLD.\n\nWe release both Mixtral\u00a08x7B and Mixtral\u00a08x7B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct under the Apache 2.0 license^{1}^{1}1https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/, free for academic and commercial usage, ensuring broad accessibility and potential for diverse applications. To enable the community to run Mixtral with a fully open-source stack, we submitted changes to the vLLM project, which integrates Megablocks CUDA kernels for efficient inference. Skypilot also allows the deployment of vLLM endpoints on any instance in the cloud.\n\n##  2 Architectural details\n\n   Parameter Value  \n dim  \n n_layers  \n head_dim  \n hidden_dim  \n n_heads  \n n_kv_heads  \n context_len  \n vocab_size  \n num_experts  \n top_k_experts  \n\n Table 1: Model architecture.\n\nMixtral is based on a transformer architecture\u00a0[31] and uses the same modifications as described in [18], with the notable exceptions that Mixtral supports a fully dense context length of 32k tokens, and the feedforward blocks are replaced by Mixture-of-Expert layers (Section\u00a02.1). The model architecture parameters are summarized in Table\u00a01.\n\n###  2.1 Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 1: Mixture of Experts Layer. Each input vector is assigned to 2 of the 8 experts by a router. The layer\u2019s output is the weighted sum of the outputs of the two selected experts. In Mixtral, an expert is a standard feedforward block as in a vanilla transformer architecture. \n\nWe present a brief overview of the Mixture of Experts layer (Figure\u00a01). For a more in-depth overview, see [12]. The output of the MoE module for a given input is determined by the weighted sum of the outputs of the expert networks, where the weights are given by the gating network\u2019s output. i.e. given expert networks , the output of the expert layer is given by:\n\nHere, denotes the -dimensional output of the gating network for the -th expert, and is the output of the -th expert network. If the gating vector is sparse, we can avoid computing the outputs of experts whose gates are zero. There are multiple alternative ways of implementing \u00a0[6, 15, 35], but a simple and performant one is implemented by taking the softmax over the Top-K logits of a linear layer\u00a0[28]. We use\n\nwhere if is among the top-K coordinates of logits and otherwise. The value of K \u2013 the number of experts used per token \u2013 is a hyper-parameter that modulates the amount of compute used to process each token. If one increases while keeping fixed, one can increase the model\u2019s parameter count while keeping its computational cost effectively constant. This motivates a distinction between the model\u2019s total parameter count (commonly referenced as the sparse parameter count), which grows with , and the number of parameters used for processing an individual token (called the active parameter count), which grows with up to .\n\nMoE layers can be run efficiently on single GPUs with high performance specialized kernels. For example, Megablocks\u00a0[13] casts the feed-forward network (FFN) operations of the MoE layer as large sparse matrix multiplications, significantly enhancing the execution speed and naturally handling cases where different experts get a variable number of tokens assigned to them. Moreover, the MoE layer can be distributed to multiple GPUs through standard Model Parallelism techniques, and through a particular kind of partitioning strategy called Expert Parallelism (EP)\u00a0[28]. During the MoE layer\u2019s execution, tokens meant to be processed by a specific expert are routed to the corresponding GPU for processing, and the expert\u2019s output is returned to the original token location. Note that EP introduces challenges in load balancing, as it is essential to distribute the workload evenly across the GPUs to prevent overloading individual GPUs or hitting computational bottlenecks.\n\nIn a Transformer model, the MoE layer is applied independently per token and replaces the feed-forward (FFN) sub-block of the transformer block. For Mixtral we use the same SwiGLU architecture as the expert function and set . This means each token is routed to two SwiGLU sub-blocks with different sets of weights. Taking this all together, the output for an input token is computed as:\n\nThis formulation is similar to the GShard architecture [21], with the exceptions that we replace all FFN sub-blocks by MoE layers while GShard replaces every other block, and that GShard uses a more elaborate gating strategy for the second expert assigned to each token.\n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe compare Mixtral to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison. We measure performance on a wide variety of tasks categorized as follow:\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] Figure 2:  Performance of Mixtral and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks.

Figure\u00a02 compares the performance of Mixtral with the Llama models in different categories. Mixtral surpasses Llama 2 70B across most metrics. In particular, Mixtral displays a superior performance in code and mathematics benchmarks.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 3:  Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension, math and code for Mistral (7B/8x7B) vs Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mixtral largely outperforms Llama 2 70B on all benchmarks, except on reading comprehension benchmarks while using 5x lower active parameters. It is also vastly superior to Llama 2 70B on code and math. \n\nSize and Efficiency. We compare our performance to the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mixtral models\u2019 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure\u00a03). As a sparse Mixture-of-Experts model, Mixtral only uses 13B active parameters for each token. With 5x lower active parameters, Mixtral is able to outperform Llama 2 70B across most categories.\n\nNote that this analysis focuses on the active parameter count (see Section\u00a02.1), which is directly proportional to the inference compute cost, but does not consider the memory costs and hardware utilization. The memory costs for serving Mixtral are proportional to its sparse parameter count, 47B, which is still smaller than Llama 2 70B. As for device utilization, we note that the SMoEs layer introduces additional overhead due to the routing mechanism and due to the increased memory loads when running more than one expert per device. They are more suitable for batched workloads where one can reach a good degree of arithmetic intensity.\n\nComparison with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. In Table\u00a03, we report the performance of Mixtral\u00a08x7B compared to Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5. We observe that Mixtral performs similarly or above the two other models. On MMLU, Mixtral obtains a better performance, despite its significantly smaller capacity (47B tokens compared to 70B). For MT Bench, we report the performance of the latest GPT-3.5-Turbo model available, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106.\n\nEvaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\n\n     LLaMA 2 70B GPT-3.5 Mixtral\u00a08x7B  \n    MMLU  \n (MCQ in 57 subjects)  \n69.9% 70.0% 70.6%  \n    HellaSwag  \n (10-shot)  \n 87.1% 85.5% 86.7%  \n    ARC Challenge  \n (25-shot)  \n85.1% 85.2% 85.8%  \n    WinoGrande  \n (5-shot)  \n83.2% 81.6% 81.2%  \n    MBPP  \n (pass@1)  \n49.8% 52.2% 60.7%  \n    GSM-8K  \n (5-shot)  \n53.6% 57.1% 58.4%  \n    MT Bench  \n (for Instruct Models)  \n6.86 8.32 8.30  \nTable 3: Comparison of Mixtral with Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5.

The extra capacity allows Mixtral to perform well on multilingual benchmarks while maintaining a high accuracy in English. In particular, Mixtral significantly outperforms Llama 2 70B in French, German, Spanish, and Italian, as shown in Table\u00a04.\n\n        Active  Params French German Spanish Italian  \n Model Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU Arc-c HellaS MMLU  \n LLaMA 1 33B 33B 39.3% 68.1% 49.9% 41.1% 63.3% 48.7% 45.7% 69.8% 52.3% 42.9% 65.4% 49.0%  \n LLaMA 2 70B 70B 49.9% 72.5% 64.3% 47.3% 68.7% 64.2% 50.5% 74.5% 66.0% 49.4% 70.9% 65.1%  \n Mixtral\u00a08x7B 13B 58.2% 77.4% 70.9% 54.3% 73.0% 71.5% 55.4% 77.6% 72.5% 52.8% 75.1% 70.9%  \nTable 4:  Comparison of Mixtral with Llama on Multilingual Benchmarks.

Results in Figure\u00a04 (Left) show that Mixtral achieves a 100% retrieval accuracy regardless of the context length or the position of passkey in the sequence. Figure\u00a04 (Right) shows that the perplexity of Mixtral on a subset of the proof-pile dataset\u00a0[2] decreases monotonically as the size of the context increases.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption]\n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 4: Long range performance of Mixtral. (Left) Mixtral has 100% retrieval accuracy of the Passkey task regardless of the location of the passkey and length of the input sequence.

Compared Llama 2 70B, Mixtral presents less bias (higher accuracy on BBQ, lower std on BOLD) and displays more positive sentiment (higher avg on BOLD).\n\n###  3.3 Bias Benchmarks\n\nTo identify possible flaws to be corrected by fine-tuning / preference modeling, we measure the base model performance on Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)\u00a0[24] and Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD)\u00a0[10]. BBQ is a dataset of hand-written question sets that target attested social biases against nine different socially-relevant categories: age, disability status, gender identity, nationality, physical appearance, race/ethnicity, religion, socio-economic status, sexual orientation. BOLD is a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains.\n\nWe benchmark Llama 2 and Mixtral on BBQ and BOLD with our evaluation framework and report the results in Table\u00a05. Compared to Llama 2, Mixtral presents less bias on the BBQ benchmark (56.0% vs 51.5%). For each group in BOLD, a higher average sentiment score means more positive sentiments and a lower standard deviation indicates less bias within the group. Overall, Mixtral displays more positive sentiments than Llama 2, with similar variances within each group.\n\n##  4 Instruction Fine-tuning\n\nWe train Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an instruction dataset followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)\u00a0[25] on a paired feedback dataset. Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct reaches a score of 8.30 on MT-Bench\u00a0[33] (see Table\u00a02), making it the best open-weights model as of December 2023. Independent human evaluation conducted by LMSys is reported in Figure\u00a06^{3}^{3}3https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard and shows that Mixtral\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Gemini Pro, Claude-2.1, and Llama\u00a02\u00a070B chat.\n\n[Image 6: Refer to caption] Figure 6:  LMSys Leaderboard. (Screenshot from Dec 22, 2023) Mixtral\u00a08x7B Instruct v0.1 achieves an Arena Elo rating of 1121 outperforming Claude-2.1 (1117), all versions of GPT-3.5-Turbo (1117 best), Gemini Pro (1111), and Llama-2-70b-chat (1077). Mixtral is currently the best open-weights model by a large margin.   \n\n##  5 Routing analysis\n\nIn this section, we perform a small analysis on the expert selection by the router. In particular, we are interested to see if during training some experts specialized to some specific domains (e.g. mathematics, biology, philosophy, etc.).\n\nTo investigate this, we measure the distribution of selected experts on different subsets of The Pile validation dataset\u00a0[14]. Results are presented in Figure\u00a07, for layers 0, 15, and 31 (layers 0 and 31 respectively being the first and the last layers of the model). Surprisingly, we do not observe obvious patterns in the assignment of experts based on the topic. For instance, at all layers, the distribution of expert assignment is very similar for ArXiv papers (written in Latex), for biology (PubMed Abstracts), and for Philosophy (PhilPapers) documents.\n\nOnly for DM Mathematics we note a marginally different distribution of experts. This divergence is likely a consequence of the dataset\u2019s synthetic nature and its limited coverage of the natural language spectrum, and is particularly noticeable at the first and last layers, where the hidden states are very correlated to the input and output embeddings respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the router does exhibit some structured syntactic behavior. Figure\u00a08 shows examples of text from different domains (Python code, mathematics, and English), where each token is highlighted with a background color corresponding to its selected expert. The figure shows that words such as \u2018self\u2019 in Python and \u2018Question\u2019 in English often get routed through the same expert even though they involve multiple tokens. Similarly, in code, the indentation tokens are always assigned to the same experts, particularly at the first and last layers where the hidden states are more correlated to the input and output of the model.\n\nWe also note from Figure\u00a08 that consecutive tokens are often assigned the same experts. In fact, we observe some degree of positional locality in The Pile datasets. Table\u00a05 shows the proportion of consecutive tokens that get the same expert assignments per domain and layer. The proportion of repeated\n\n[Image 7: Refer to caption] Figure 7:  Proportion of tokens assigned to each expert on different domains from The Pile dataset for layers 0, 15, and 31. The gray dashed vertical line marks , i.e. the proportion expected with uniform sampling. Here, we consider experts that are either selected as a first or second choice by the router. A breakdown of the proportion of assignments done in each case cane be seen in Figure\u00a09 in the Appendix. \n\nconsecutive assignments is significantly higher than random for higher layers. This has implications in how one might optimize the model for fast training and inference. For example, cases with high locality are more likely to cause over-subscription of certain experts when doing Expert Parallelism. Conversely, this locality can be leveraged for caching, as is done in [11]. A more complete view of these same expert frequency is provided for all layers and across datasets in Figure\u00a010 in the Appendix.\n\n[Image 8: Refer to caption] Figure 8: Text samples where each token is colored with the first expert choice. The selection of experts appears to be more aligned with the syntax rather than the domain, especially at the initial and final layers.

However, pre-trained language models are usually computationally expensive, so it is difficult to efficiently execute them on resource-restricted devices. To accelerate inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy, we first propose a novel Transformer distillation method that is specially designed for knowledge distillation (KD) of the Transformer-based models. By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large \u201cteacher\u201d BERT can be effectively transferred to a small \u201cstudent\u201d TinyBERT. Then, we introduce a new two-stage learning framework for TinyBERT, which performs Transformer distillation at both the pre-training and task-specific learning stages. This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture the general-domain as well as the task-specific knowledge in BERT.\n\nTinyBERT^{1}^{1}1 The code and models are publicly available at \u30100\u2020https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/TinyBERT\u2020github.com\u3011 with 4 layers is empirically effective and achieves more than 96.8% the performance of its teacher BERT on GLUE benchmark, while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference. TinyBERT is also significantly better than 4-layer state-of-the-art baselines on BERT distillation, with only 28% parameters and 31% inference time of them. Moreover, TinyBERT with 6 layers performs on-par with its teacher BERT. \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nPre-training language models then fine-tuning on downstream tasks has become a new paradigm for natural language processing\u00a0(NLP). Pre-trained language models\u00a0(PLMs), such as BERT\u00a0Devlin et\u00a0al. (\u30101\u20202019\u3011), XLNet\u00a0Yang et\u00a0al. (\u30102\u20202019\u3011), RoBERTa\u00a0Liu et\u00a0al. (\u30103\u20202019\u3011), ALBERT\u00a0Lan et\u00a0al. (\u30104\u20202020\u3011), T5\u00a0Raffel et\u00a0al. (\u30105\u20202019\u3011) and ELECTRA\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (\u30106\u20202020\u3011), have achieved great success in many NLP tasks (e.g., the GLUE benchmark\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (\u30107\u20202018\u3011) and the challenging multi-hop reasoning task\u00a0Ding et\u00a0al. (\u30108\u20202019\u3011)). However, PLMs usually have a large number of parameters and take long inference time, which are difficult to be deployed on edge devices such as mobile phones. Recent studies\u00a0Kovaleva et\u00a0al. (\u30109\u20202019\u3011); Michel et\u00a0al. (\u301010\u20202019\u3011); Voita et\u00a0al. (\u301011\u20202019\u3011) demonstrate that there is redundancy in PLMs. Therefore, it is crucial and feasible to reduce the computational overhead and model storage of PLMs while retaining their performances.\n\nThere have been many model compression techniques\u00a0Han et\u00a0al. (\u301012\u20202016\u3011) proposed to accelerate deep model inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. The most commonly used techniques include quantization\u00a0Gong et\u00a0al. (\u301013\u20202014\u3011), weights pruning\u00a0Han et\u00a0al. (\u301014\u20202015\u3011), and knowledge distillation\u00a0(KD)\u00a0Romero et\u00a0al. (\u301015\u20202014\u3011). In this paper, we focus on knowledge distillation, an idea originated from\u00a0Hinton et\u00a0al. (\u301016\u20202015\u3011), in a teacher-student framework. KD aims to transfer the knowledge embedded in a large teacher network to a small student network where the student network is trained to reproduce the behaviors of the teacher network. Based on the framework, we propose a novel distillation method specifically for the Transformer-based models\u00a0Vaswani et\u00a0al. (\u301017\u20202017\u3011), and use BERT as an example to investigate the method for large-scale PLMs.\n\nKD has been extensively studied in NLP\u00a0Kim and Rush (\u301018\u20202016\u3011); Hu et\u00a0al. (\u301019\u20202018\u3011) as well as for pre-trained language models Sanh et\u00a0al. (\u301020\u20202019\u3011); Sun et\u00a0al. (\u301021\u20202019\u3011, \u301022\u20202020\u3011); Wang et\u00a0al. (\u301023\u20202020\u3011). The pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm firstly pre-trains BERT on a large-scale unsupervised text corpus, then fine-tunes it on task-specific dataset, which greatly increases the difficulty of BERT distillation. Therefore, it is required to design an effective KD strategy for both training stages.\n\nTo build a competitive TinyBERT, we firstly propose a new Transformer distillation method to distill the knowledge embedded in teacher BERT. Specifically, we design three types of loss functions to fit different representations from BERT layers: 1) the output of the embedding layer; 2) the hidden states and attention matrices derived from the Transformer layer; 3) the logits output by the prediction layer. The attention based fitting is inspired by the recent findings\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (\u301024\u20202019\u3011) that the attention weights learned by BERT can capture substantial linguistic knowledge, and it thus encourages the linguistic knowledge can be well transferred from teacher BERT to student TinyBERT. Then, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework including the general distillation and the task-specific distillation, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01. At general distillation stage, the original BERT without fine-tuning acts as the teacher model. The student TinyBERT mimics the teacher\u2019s behavior through the proposed Transformer distillation on general-domain corpus. After that, we obtain a general TinyBERT that is used as the initialization of student model for the further distillation. At the task-specific distillation stage, we first do the data augmentation, then perform the distillation on the augmented dataset using the fine-tuned BERT as the teacher model. It should be pointed out that both the two stages are essential to improve the performance and generalization capability of TinyBERT.\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: The illustration of TinyBERT learning.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We propose a new Transformer distillation method to encourage that the linguistic knowledge encoded in teacher BERT can be adequately transferred to TinyBERT; 2) We propose a novel two-stage learning framework with performing the proposed Transformer distillation at both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, which ensures that TinyBERT can absorb both the general-domain and task-specific knowledge of the teacher BERT. 3) We show in the experiments that our TinyBERT can achieve more than 96.8% the performance of teacher BERT on GLUE tasks, while having much fewer parameters (13.3%) and less inference time (10.6%), and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines with 4 layers on BERT distillation; 4) We also show that a 6-layer TinyBERT can perform on-par with the teacher BERT on GLUE.\n\n##  2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we describe the formulation of Transformer\u00a0Vaswani et\u00a0al. (\u301017\u20202017\u3011) and Knowledge Distillation\u00a0Hinton et\u00a0al. (\u301016\u20202015\u3011). Our proposed Transformer distillation is a specially designed KD method for Transformer-based models.\n\n###  2.1 Transformer Layer\n\nMost of the recent pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, XLNet and RoBERTa) are built with Transformer layers, which can capture long-term dependencies between input tokens by self-attention mechanism. Specifically, a standard Transformer layer includes two main sub-layers: multi-head attention\u00a0(MHA) and fully connected feed-forward network\u00a0(FFN).\n\nMulti-Head Attention (MHA). The calculation of attention function depends on the three components of queries, keys and values, denoted as matrices , and respectively. The attention function can be formulated as follows:\n\n  (1)  \n(2)  \n\nwhere is the dimension of keys and acts as a scaling factor, is the attention matrix calculated from the compatibility of and by dot-product operation. The final function output is calculated as a weighted sum of values , and the weight is computed by applying softmax() operation on the each column of matrix . According to Clark et al.\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (\u301024\u20202019\u3011), the attention matrices in BERT can capture substantial linguistic knowledge, and thus play an essential role in our proposed distillation method.\n\nMulti-head attention is defined by concatenating the attention heads from different representation subspaces as follows:\n\n  (3)  \n\nwhere is the number of attention heads, and denotes the -th attention head, which is calculated by the function with inputs from different representation subspaces. The matrix acts as a linear transformation.\n\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN). Transformer layer also contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is formulated as follows:\n\n  (4)  \n\nWe can see that the FFN contains two linear transformations and one ReLU activation.\n\n###  2.2 Knowledge Distillation\n\nKD aims to transfer the knowledge of a large teacher network to a small student network . The student network is trained to mimic the behaviors of teacher networks. Let and represent the behavior functions of teacher and student networks, respectively. The behavior function targets at transforming network inputs to some informative representations, and it can be defined as the output of any layer in the network. In the context of Transformer distillation, the output of MHA layer or FFN layer, or some intermediate representations (such as the attention matrix ) can be used as behavior function. Formally, KD can be modeled as minimizing the following objective function:\n\n  (5)  \n\nwhere is a loss function that evaluates the difference between teacher and student networks, is the text input and denotes the training dataset. Thus the key research problem becomes how to define effective behavior functions and loss functions. Different from previous KD methods, we also need to consider how to perform KD at the pre-training stage of BERT in addition to the task-specific training stage. \n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: The details of Transformer-layer distillation consisting of Attn(attention based distillation) and Hidn(hidden states based distillation).   \n\n##  3 Method\n\nIn this section, we propose a novel distillation method for Transformer-based models, and present a two-stage learning framework for our model distilled from BERT, which is called TinyBERT.\n\n###  3.1 Transformer Distillation\n\nThe proposed Transformer distillation is a specially designed KD method for Transformer networks. In this work, both the student and teacher networks are built with Transformer layers. For a clear illustration, we formulate the problem before introducing our method. \n\nProblem Formulation. Assuming that the student model has Transformer layers and teacher model has Transformer layers, we start with choosing out of layers from the teacher model for the Transformer-layer distillation. Then a function is defined as the mapping function between indices from student layers to teacher layers, which means that the -th layer of student model learns the information from the -th layer of teacher model. To be precise, we set 0 to be the index of embedding layer and to be the index of prediction layer, and the corresponding layer mappings are defined as and respectively. The effect of the choice of different mapping functions on the performances is studied in the experiment section. Formally, the student can acquire knowledge from the teacher by minimizing the following objective:\n\n  (6)  \n\nwhere refers to the loss function of a given model layer\u00a0(e.g., Transformer layer or embedding layer), denotes the behavior function induced from the -th layers and is the hyper-parameter that represents the importance of the -th layer\u2019s distillation.\n\nTransformer-layer Distillation. The proposed Transformer-layer distillation includes the attention based distillation and hidden states based distillation, which is shown in Figure\u00a02. The attention based distillation is motivated by the recent findings that attention weights learned by BERT can capture rich linguistic knowledge\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (\u301024\u20202019\u3011). This kind of linguistic knowledge includes the syntax and coreference information, which is essential for natural language understanding. Thus we propose the attention based distillation to encourage that the linguistic knowledge can be transferred from teacher (BERT) to student (TinyBERT). Specifically, the student learns to fit the matrices of multi-head attention in the teacher network, and the objective is defined as:\n\n  (7)  \n\nwhere is the number of attention heads, refers to the attention matrix corresponding to the -th head of teacher or student, is the input text length, and MSE() means the mean squared error loss function. In this work, the (unnormalized) attention matrix is used as the fitting target instead of its softmax output , since our experiments show that the former setting has a faster convergence rate and better performances.\n\nIn addition to the attention based distillation, we also distill the knowledge from the output of Transformer layer, and the objective is as follows: \n\n  (8)  \n\nwhere the matrices and refer to the hidden states of student and teacher networks respectively, which are calculated by Equation\u00a04. The scalar values and denote the hidden sizes of teacher and student models, and is often smaller than to obtain a smaller student network. The matrix is a learnable linear transformation, which transforms the hidden states of student network into the same space as the teacher network\u2019s states.\n\nEmbedding-layer Distillation. Similar to the hidden states based distillation, we also perform embedding-layer distillation and the objective is:\n\n  (9)  \n\nwhere the matrices and refer to the embeddings of student and teacher networks, respectively. In this paper, they have the same shape as the hidden state matrices. The matrix is a linear transformation playing a similar role as .\n\nPrediction-layer Distillation. In addition to imitating the behaviors of intermediate layers, we also use the knowledge distillation to fit the predictions of teacher model as in\u00a0Hinton et\u00a0al. (\u301016\u20202015\u3011). Specifically, we penalize the soft cross-entropy loss between the student network\u2019s logits against the teacher\u2019s logits:\n\n  (10)  \n\nwhere and are the logits vectors predicted by the student and teacher respectively, CE means the cross entropy loss, and means the temperature value. In our experiment, we find that performs well. \n\nUsing the above distillation objectives\u00a0(i.e. Equations\u00a07, 8, 9 and 10), we can unify the distillation loss of the corresponding layers between the teacher and the student network:\n\n  (11)  \n\n###  3.2 TinyBERT Learning\n\nThe application of BERT usually consists of two learning stages: the pre-training and fine-tuning. The plenty of knowledge learned by BERT in the pre-training stage is of great importance and should be transferred to the compressed model. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework including the general distillation and the task-specific distillation, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01. General distillation helps TinyBERT learn the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained BERT, which plays an important role in improving the generalization capability of TinyBERT. The task-specific distillation further teaches TinyBERT the knowledge from the fine-tuned BERT. With the two-step distillation, we can substantially reduce the gap between teacher and student models.\n\nGeneral Distillation. We use the original BERT without fine-tuning as the teacher and a large-scale text corpus as the training data. By performing the Transformer distillation\u00a0^{2}^{2}2 In the general distillation, we do not perform prediction-layer distillation as Equation\u00a010. Our motivation is to make the TinyBERT primarily learn the intermediate structures of BERT at pre-training stage. From our preliminary experiments, we also found that conducting prediction-layer distillation at pre-training stage does not bring extra improvements on downstream tasks, when the Transformer-layer distillation (Attn and Hidn distillation) and Embedding-layer distillation have already been performed. on the text from general domain, we obtain a general TinyBERT that can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. However, due to the significant reductions of the hidden/embedding size and the layer number, general TinyBERT performs generally worse than BERT.\n\nTask-specific Distillation. Previous studies show that the complex models, such as fine-tuned BERTs, suffer from over-parametrization for domain-specific tasks\u00a0Kovaleva et\u00a0al. (\u30109\u20202019\u3011). Thus, it is possible for smaller models to achieve comparable performances to the BERTs. To this end, we propose to produce competitive fine-tuned TinyBERTs through the task-specific distillation. In the task-specific distillation, we re-perform the proposed Transformer distillation on an augmented task-specific dataset. Specifically, the fine-tuned BERT is used as the teacher and a data augmentation method is proposed to expand the task-specific training set. Training with more task-related examples, the generalization ability of the student model can be further improved.\n\n Algorithm 1 Data Augmentation Procedure for Task-specific Distillation\n\nInput: is a sequence of words   \nParams: : the threshold probability   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : the number of samples augmented per example   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : the size of candidate set   \nOutput: : the augmented data\n\n 1:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 2:\u00a0\u00a0while\u00a0\u00a0do\n\n 3:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 4:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a01\u00a0to\u00a0len\u00a0do\n\n 5:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0 \u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0single-piece\u00a0word\u00a0then\n\n 6:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Replace with [MASK]\n\n 7:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 most probable words of \n\n 8:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0else\n\n 9:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 most similar words of from GloVe \n\n 10:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0if\n\n 11:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample Uniform(0, 1) \n\n 12:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0\u00a0then\n\n 13:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Replace with a word in randomly \n\n 14:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0if\n\n 15:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0for\n\n 16:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Append to \n\n 17:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 18:\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0while\n\n 19:\u00a0\u00a0return\n\nData Augmentation. We combine a pre-trained language model BERT and GloVe\u00a0Pennington et\u00a0al. (\u301025\u20202014\u3011) word embeddings to do word-level replacement for data augmentation. Specifically, we use the language model to predict word replacements for single-piece words\u00a0Wu et\u00a0al. (\u301026\u20202019\u3011), and use the word embeddings to retrieve the most similar words as word replacements for multiple-pieces words^{3}^{3}3 A word is tokenized into multiple word-pieces by the tokenizer of BERT.. Some hyper-parameters are defined to control the replacement ratio of a sentence and the amount of augmented dataset. More details of the data augmentation procedure are shown in Algorithm\u00a0\u301027\u20201\u3011. We set = 0.4, = 20, = 15 for all our experiments.\n\nThe above two learning stages are complementary to each other: the general distillation provides a good initialization for the task-specific distillation, while the task-specific distillation on the augmented data further improves TinyBERT by focusing on learning the task-specific knowledge. Although there is a significant reduction of model size, with the data augmentation and by performing the proposed Transformer distillation method at both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, TinyBERT can achieve competitive performances in various NLP tasks. \n\n##  4 Experiments\n\n   System #Params #FLOPs Speedup MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Avg  \n BERT (Teacher) 109M 22.5B 1.0x 83.9/83.4 71.1 90.9 93.4 52.8 85.2 87.5 67.0 79.5  \n BERT  14.5M 1.2B 9.4x 75.4/74.9 66.5 84.8 87.6 19.5 77.1 83.2 62.6 70.2  \n BERT  29.2M 3.4B 5.7x 77.6/77.0 68.1 86.4 89.7 27.8 77.0 83.4 61.8 72.1  \n BERT-PKD 52.2M 7.6B 3.0x 79.9/79.3 70.2 85.1 89.4 24.8 79.8 82.6 62.3 72.6  \n DistilBERT  52.2M 7.6B 3.0x 78.9/78.0 68.5 85.2 91.4 32.8 76.1 82.4 54.1 71.9  \n MobileBERT  15.1M 3.1B - 81.5/81.6 68.9 89.5 91.7 46.7 80.1 87.9 65.1 77.0  \n TinyBERT (ours) 14.5M 1.2B 9.4x  82.5/81.8 71.3 87.7 92.6 44.1 80.4 86.4 66.6 77.0  \n BERT-PKD 67.0M 11.3B 2.0x 81.5/81.0 70.7 89.0 92.0 - - 85.0 65.5 -  \n PD 67.0M 11.3B 2.0x 82.8/82.2 70.4 88.9 91.8 - - 86.8 65.3 -  \n DistilBERT  67.0M 11.3B 2.0x 82.6/81.3 70.1 88.9 92.5 49.0 81.3 86.9 58.4 76.8  \n TinyBERT (ours) 67.0M 11.3B 2.0x  84.6/83.2 71.6 90.4 93.1 51.1 83.7 87.3 70.0 79.4  \n\nTable 1: Results are evaluated on the test set of GLUE official benchmark.

(\u30107\u20202018\u3011) benchmark, which consists of 2 single-sentence tasks: CoLA\u00a0Warstadt et\u00a0al. (\u301028\u20202019\u3011), SST-2\u00a0Socher et\u00a0al. (\u301029\u20202013\u3011), 3 sentence similarity tasks: MRPC\u00a0Dolan and Brockett (\u301030\u20202005\u3011), STS-B\u00a0Cer et\u00a0al. (\u301031\u20202017\u3011), QQP\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (\u301032\u20202018\u3011), and 4 natural language inference tasks: MNLI\u00a0Williams et\u00a0al. (\u301033\u20202018\u3011), QNLI\u00a0Rajpurkar et\u00a0al. (\u301034\u20202016\u3011), RTE\u00a0Bentivogli et\u00a0al. (\u301035\u20202009\u3011) and WNLI\u00a0Levesque et\u00a0al. (\u301036\u20202012\u3011). The metrics for these tasks can be found in the GLUE paper\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (\u30107\u20202018\u3011).\n\n###  4.2 TinyBERT Settings\n\nWe instantiate a tiny student model (the number of layers =4, the hidden size =312, the feed-forward/filter size =1200 and the head number =12) that has a total of 14.5M parameters. This model is referred to as TinyBERT. The original BERT (=12, =768, =3072 and =12) is used as the teacher model that contains 109M parameters. We use as the layer mapping function, so TinyBERT learns from every 3 layers of BERT. The learning weight of each layer is set to 1. Besides, for a direct comparisons with baselines, we also instantiate a TinyBERT\u00a0(=6, =768, =3072 and =12) with the same architecture as BERT-PKD\u00a0Sun et\u00a0al. (\u301021\u20202019\u3011) and DistilBERT\u00a0Sanh et\u00a0al. (\u301020\u20202019\u3011).\n\nTinyBERT learning includes the general distillation and the task-specific distillation. For the general distillation, we set the maximum sequence length to 128 and use English Wikipedia (2,500M words) as the text corpus and perform the intermediate layer distillation for 3 epochs with the supervision from a pre-trained BERT and keep other hyper-parameters the same as BERT pre-training\u00a0Devlin et\u00a0al. (\u30101\u20202019\u3011). For the task-specific distillation, under the supervision of a fine-tuned BERT, we firstly perform intermediate layer distillation on the augmented data for 20 epochs^{4}^{4}4 For large datasets MNLI, QQP, and QNLI, we only perform 10 epochs of the intermediate layer distillation, and for the challenging task CoLA, we perform 50 epochs at this step. with batch size 32 and learning rate 5e-5, and then perform prediction layer distillation on the augmented data\u00a0^{5}^{5}5 For regression task STS-B, the original train set is better. for 3 epochs with choosing the batch size from {16, 32} and learning rate from {1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5} on dev set. At task-specific distillation, the maximum sequence length is set to 64 for single-sentence tasks, and 128 for sequence pair tasks.\n\n###  4.3 Baselines\n\nWe compare TinyBERT with BERT, BERT^{6}^{6}6\u301037\u2020https://github.com/google-research/bert\u2020github.com\u3011\u00a0Turc et\u00a0al. (\u301038\u20202019\u3011) and several state-of-the-art KD baselines including BERT-PKD\u00a0Sun et\u00a0al. (\u301021\u20202019\u3011), PD\u00a0Turc et\u00a0al.

However, pre-trained language models are usually computationally expensive, so it is difficult to efficiently execute them on resource-restricted devices. To accelerate inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy, we first propose a novel Transformer distillation method that is specially designed for knowledge distillation (KD) of the Transformer-based models. By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large \u201cteacher\u201d BERT can be effectively transferred to a small \u201cstudent\u201d TinyBERT. Then, we introduce a new two-stage learning framework for TinyBERT, which performs Transformer distillation at both the pre-training and task-specific learning stages. This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture the general-domain as well as the task-specific knowledge in BERT.\n\nTinyBERT^{1}^{1}1 The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/TinyBERT with 4 layers is empirically effective and achieves more than 96.8% the performance of its teacher BERT on GLUE benchmark, while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference. TinyBERT is also significantly better than 4-layer state-of-the-art baselines on BERT distillation, with only 28% parameters and 31% inference time of them. Moreover, TinyBERT with 6 layers performs on-par with its teacher BERT. \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nPre-training language models then fine-tuning on downstream tasks has become a new paradigm for natural language processing\u00a0(NLP). Pre-trained language models\u00a0(PLMs), such as BERT\u00a0Devlin et\u00a0al. (2019), XLNet\u00a0Yang et\u00a0al. (2019), RoBERTa\u00a0Liu et\u00a0al. (2019), ALBERT\u00a0Lan et\u00a0al. (2020), T5\u00a0Raffel et\u00a0al. (2019) and ELECTRA\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (2020), have achieved great success in many NLP tasks (e.g., the GLUE benchmark\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2018) and the challenging multi-hop reasoning task\u00a0Ding et\u00a0al. (2019)). However, PLMs usually have a large number of parameters and take long inference time, which are difficult to be deployed on edge devices such as mobile phones. Recent studies\u00a0Kovaleva et\u00a0al. (2019); Michel et\u00a0al. (2019); Voita et\u00a0al. (2019) demonstrate that there is redundancy in PLMs. Therefore, it is crucial and feasible to reduce the computational overhead and model storage of PLMs while retaining their performances.\n\nThere have been many model compression techniques\u00a0Han et\u00a0al. (2016) proposed to accelerate deep model inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy. The most commonly used techniques include quantization\u00a0Gong et\u00a0al. (2014), weights pruning\u00a0Han et\u00a0al. (2015), and knowledge distillation\u00a0(KD)\u00a0Romero et\u00a0al. (2014). In this paper, we focus on knowledge distillation, an idea originated from\u00a0Hinton et\u00a0al. (2015), in a teacher-student framework. KD aims to transfer the knowledge embedded in a large teacher network to a small student network where the student network is trained to reproduce the behaviors of the teacher network. Based on the framework, we propose a novel distillation method specifically for the Transformer-based models\u00a0Vaswani et\u00a0al. (2017), and use BERT as an example to investigate the method for large-scale PLMs.\n\nKD has been extensively studied in NLP\u00a0Kim and Rush (2016); Hu et\u00a0al. (2018) as well as for pre-trained language models Sanh et\u00a0al. (2019); Sun et\u00a0al. (2019, 2020); Wang et\u00a0al. (2020). The pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm firstly pre-trains BERT on a large-scale unsupervised text corpus, then fine-tunes it on task-specific dataset, which greatly increases the difficulty of BERT distillation. Therefore, it is required to design an effective KD strategy for both training stages.\n\nTo build a competitive TinyBERT, we firstly propose a new Transformer distillation method to distill the knowledge embedded in teacher BERT. Specifically, we design three types of loss functions to fit different representations from BERT layers: 1) the output of the embedding layer; 2) the hidden states and attention matrices derived from the Transformer layer; 3) the logits output by the prediction layer. The attention based fitting is inspired by the recent findings\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (2019) that the attention weights learned by BERT can capture substantial linguistic knowledge, and it thus encourages the linguistic knowledge can be well transferred from teacher BERT to student TinyBERT. Then, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework including the general distillation and the task-specific distillation, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01. At general distillation stage, the original BERT without fine-tuning acts as the teacher model. The student TinyBERT mimics the teacher\u2019s behavior through the proposed Transformer distillation on general-domain corpus. After that, we obtain a general TinyBERT that is used as the initialization of student model for the further distillation. At the task-specific distillation stage, we first do the data augmentation, then perform the distillation on the augmented dataset using the fine-tuned BERT as the teacher model. It should be pointed out that both the two stages are essential to improve the performance and generalization capability of TinyBERT.\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: The illustration of TinyBERT learning.\n\nThe main contributions of this work are as follows: 1) We propose a new Transformer distillation method to encourage that the linguistic knowledge encoded in teacher BERT can be adequately transferred to TinyBERT; 2) We propose a novel two-stage learning framework with performing the proposed Transformer distillation at both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, which ensures that TinyBERT can absorb both the general-domain and task-specific knowledge of the teacher BERT. 3) We show in the experiments that our TinyBERT can achieve more than 96.8% the performance of teacher BERT on GLUE tasks, while having much fewer parameters (13.3%) and less inference time (10.6%), and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines with 4 layers on BERT distillation; 4) We also show that a 6-layer TinyBERT can perform on-par with the teacher BERT on GLUE.\n\n##  2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we describe the formulation of Transformer\u00a0Vaswani et\u00a0al. (2017) and Knowledge Distillation\u00a0Hinton et\u00a0al. (2015). Our proposed Transformer distillation is a specially designed KD method for Transformer-based models.\n\n###  2.1 Transformer Layer\n\nMost of the recent pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, XLNet and RoBERTa) are built with Transformer layers, which can capture long-term dependencies between input tokens by self-attention mechanism. Specifically, a standard Transformer layer includes two main sub-layers: multi-head attention\u00a0(MHA) and fully connected feed-forward network\u00a0(FFN).\n\nMulti-Head Attention (MHA). The calculation of attention function depends on the three components of queries, keys and values, denoted as matrices , and respectively. The attention function can be formulated as follows:\n\n  (1)  \n(2)  \n\nwhere is the dimension of keys and acts as a scaling factor, is the attention matrix calculated from the compatibility of and by dot-product operation. The final function output is calculated as a weighted sum of values , and the weight is computed by applying softmax() operation on the each column of matrix . According to Clark et al.\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (2019), the attention matrices in BERT can capture substantial linguistic knowledge, and thus play an essential role in our proposed distillation method.\n\nMulti-head attention is defined by concatenating the attention heads from different representation subspaces as follows:\n\n  (3)  \n\nwhere is the number of attention heads, and denotes the -th attention head, which is calculated by the function with inputs from different representation subspaces. The matrix acts as a linear transformation.\n\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Network (FFN). Transformer layer also contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is formulated as follows:\n\n  (4)  \n\nWe can see that the FFN contains two linear transformations and one ReLU activation.\n\n###  2.2 Knowledge Distillation\n\nKD aims to transfer the knowledge of a large teacher network to a small student network . The student network is trained to mimic the behaviors of teacher networks. Let and represent the behavior functions of teacher and student networks, respectively. The behavior function targets at transforming network inputs to some informative representations, and it can be defined as the output of any layer in the network. In the context of Transformer distillation, the output of MHA layer or FFN layer, or some intermediate representations (such as the attention matrix ) can be used as behavior function. Formally, KD can be modeled as minimizing the following objective function:\n\n  (5)  \n\nwhere is a loss function that evaluates the difference between teacher and student networks, is the text input and denotes the training dataset. Thus the key research problem becomes how to define effective behavior functions and loss functions. Different from previous KD methods, we also need to consider how to perform KD at the pre-training stage of BERT in addition to the task-specific training stage. \n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: The details of Transformer-layer distillation consisting of Attn(attention based distillation) and Hidn(hidden states based distillation).   \n\n##  3 Method\n\nIn this section, we propose a novel distillation method for Transformer-based models, and present a two-stage learning framework for our model distilled from BERT, which is called TinyBERT.\n\n###  3.1 Transformer Distillation\n\nThe proposed Transformer distillation is a specially designed KD method for Transformer networks. In this work, both the student and teacher networks are built with Transformer layers. For a clear illustration, we formulate the problem before introducing our method. \n\nProblem Formulation. Assuming that the student model has Transformer layers and teacher model has Transformer layers, we start with choosing out of layers from the teacher model for the Transformer-layer distillation. Then a function is defined as the mapping function between indices from student layers to teacher layers, which means that the -th layer of student model learns the information from the -th layer of teacher model. To be precise, we set 0 to be the index of embedding layer and to be the index of prediction layer, and the corresponding layer mappings are defined as and respectively. The effect of the choice of different mapping functions on the performances is studied in the experiment section. Formally, the student can acquire knowledge from the teacher by minimizing the following objective:\n\n  (6)  \n\nwhere refers to the loss function of a given model layer\u00a0(e.g., Transformer layer or embedding layer), denotes the behavior function induced from the -th layers and is the hyper-parameter that represents the importance of the -th layer\u2019s distillation.\n\nTransformer-layer Distillation. The proposed Transformer-layer distillation includes the attention based distillation and hidden states based distillation, which is shown in Figure\u00a02. The attention based distillation is motivated by the recent findings that attention weights learned by BERT can capture rich linguistic knowledge\u00a0Clark et\u00a0al. (2019). This kind of linguistic knowledge includes the syntax and coreference information, which is essential for natural language understanding. Thus we propose the attention based distillation to encourage that the linguistic knowledge can be transferred from teacher (BERT) to student (TinyBERT). Specifically, the student learns to fit the matrices of multi-head attention in the teacher network, and the objective is defined as:\n\n  (7)  \n\nwhere is the number of attention heads, refers to the attention matrix corresponding to the -th head of teacher or student, is the input text length, and MSE() means the mean squared error loss function. In this work, the (unnormalized) attention matrix is used as the fitting target instead of its softmax output , since our experiments show that the former setting has a faster convergence rate and better performances.\n\nIn addition to the attention based distillation, we also distill the knowledge from the output of Transformer layer, and the objective is as follows: \n\n  (8)  \n\nwhere the matrices and refer to the hidden states of student and teacher networks respectively, which are calculated by Equation\u00a04. The scalar values and denote the hidden sizes of teacher and student models, and is often smaller than to obtain a smaller student network. The matrix is a learnable linear transformation, which transforms the hidden states of student network into the same space as the teacher network\u2019s states.\n\nEmbedding-layer Distillation. Similar to the hidden states based distillation, we also perform embedding-layer distillation and the objective is:\n\n  (9)  \n\nwhere the matrices and refer to the embeddings of student and teacher networks, respectively. In this paper, they have the same shape as the hidden state matrices. The matrix is a linear transformation playing a similar role as .\n\nPrediction-layer Distillation. In addition to imitating the behaviors of intermediate layers, we also use the knowledge distillation to fit the predictions of teacher model as in\u00a0Hinton et\u00a0al. (2015). Specifically, we penalize the soft cross-entropy loss between the student network\u2019s logits against the teacher\u2019s logits:\n\n  (10)  \n\nwhere and are the logits vectors predicted by the student and teacher respectively, CE means the cross entropy loss, and means the temperature value. In our experiment, we find that performs well. \n\nUsing the above distillation objectives\u00a0(i.e. Equations\u00a07, 8, 9 and 10), we can unify the distillation loss of the corresponding layers between the teacher and the student network:\n\n  (11)  \n\n###  3.2 TinyBERT Learning\n\nThe application of BERT usually consists of two learning stages: the pre-training and fine-tuning. The plenty of knowledge learned by BERT in the pre-training stage is of great importance and should be transferred to the compressed model. Therefore, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework including the general distillation and the task-specific distillation, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01. General distillation helps TinyBERT learn the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained BERT, which plays an important role in improving the generalization capability of TinyBERT. The task-specific distillation further teaches TinyBERT the knowledge from the fine-tuned BERT. With the two-step distillation, we can substantially reduce the gap between teacher and student models.\n\nGeneral Distillation. We use the original BERT without fine-tuning as the teacher and a large-scale text corpus as the training data. By performing the Transformer distillation\u00a0^{2}^{2}2 In the general distillation, we do not perform prediction-layer distillation as Equation\u00a010. Our motivation is to make the TinyBERT primarily learn the intermediate structures of BERT at pre-training stage. From our preliminary experiments, we also found that conducting prediction-layer distillation at pre-training stage does not bring extra improvements on downstream tasks, when the Transformer-layer distillation (Attn and Hidn distillation) and Embedding-layer distillation have already been performed. on the text from general domain, we obtain a general TinyBERT that can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. However, due to the significant reductions of the hidden/embedding size and the layer number, general TinyBERT performs generally worse than BERT.\n\nTask-specific Distillation. Previous studies show that the complex models, such as fine-tuned BERTs, suffer from over-parametrization for domain-specific tasks\u00a0Kovaleva et\u00a0al. (2019). Thus, it is possible for smaller models to achieve comparable performances to the BERTs. To this end, we propose to produce competitive fine-tuned TinyBERTs through the task-specific distillation. In the task-specific distillation, we re-perform the proposed Transformer distillation on an augmented task-specific dataset. Specifically, the fine-tuned BERT is used as the teacher and a data augmentation method is proposed to expand the task-specific training set. Training with more task-related examples, the generalization ability of the student model can be further improved.\n\n Algorithm 1 Data Augmentation Procedure for Task-specific Distillation\n\nInput: is a sequence of words   \nParams: : the threshold probability   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : the number of samples augmented per example   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 : the size of candidate set   \nOutput: : the augmented data\n\n 1:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 2:\u00a0\u00a0while\u00a0\u00a0do\n\n 3:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 4:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a01\u00a0to\u00a0len\u00a0do\n\n 5:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0 \u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0single-piece\u00a0word\u00a0then\n\n 6:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Replace with [MASK]\n\n 7:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 most probable words of \n\n 8:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0else\n\n 9:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 most similar words of from GloVe \n\n 10:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0if\n\n 11:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sample Uniform(0, 1) \n\n 12:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0\u00a0then\n\n 13:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Replace with a word in randomly \n\n 14:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0if\n\n 15:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0for\n\n 16:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Append to \n\n 17:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 18:\u00a0\u00a0end\u00a0while\n\n 19:\u00a0\u00a0return\n\nData Augmentation. We combine a pre-trained language model BERT and GloVe\u00a0Pennington et\u00a0al. (2014) word embeddings to do word-level replacement for data augmentation. Specifically, we use the language model to predict word replacements for single-piece words\u00a0Wu et\u00a0al. (2019), and use the word embeddings to retrieve the most similar words as word replacements for multiple-pieces words^{3}^{3}3 A word is tokenized into multiple word-pieces by the tokenizer of BERT.. Some hyper-parameters are defined to control the replacement ratio of a sentence and the amount of augmented dataset. More details of the data augmentation procedure are shown in Algorithm\u00a01. We set = 0.4, = 20, = 15 for all our experiments.\n\nThe above two learning stages are complementary to each other: the general distillation provides a good initialization for the task-specific distillation, while the task-specific distillation on the augmented data further improves TinyBERT by focusing on learning the task-specific knowledge. Although there is a significant reduction of model size, with the data augmentation and by performing the proposed Transformer distillation method at both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages, TinyBERT can achieve competitive performances in various NLP tasks. \n\n##  4 Experiments\n\n   System #Params #FLOPs Speedup MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Avg  \n BERT (Teacher) 109M 22.5B 1.0x 83.9/83.4 71.1 90.9 93.4 52.8 85.2 87.5 67.0 79.5  \n BERT  14.5M 1.2B 9.4x 75.4/74.9 66.5 84.8 87.6 19.5 77.1 83.2 62.6 70.2  \n BERT  29.2M 3.4B 5.7x 77.6/77.0 68.1 86.4 89.7 27.8 77.0 83.4 61.8 72.1  \n BERT-PKD 52.2M 7.6B 3.0x 79.9/79.3 70.2 85.1 89.4 24.8 79.8 82.6 62.3 72.6  \n DistilBERT  52.2M 7.6B 3.0x 78.9/78.0 68.5 85.2 91.4 32.8 76.1 82.4 54.1 71.9  \n MobileBERT  15.1M 3.1B - 81.5/81.6 68.9 89.5 91.7 46.7 80.1 87.9 65.1 77.0  \n TinyBERT (ours) 14.5M 1.2B 9.4x  82.5/81.8 71.3 87.7 92.6 44.1 80.4 86.4 66.6 77.0  \n BERT-PKD 67.0M 11.3B 2.0x 81.5/81.0 70.7 89.0 92.0 - - 85.0 65.5 -  \n PD 67.0M 11.3B 2.0x 82.8/82.2 70.4 88.9 91.8 - - 86.8 65.3 -  \n DistilBERT  67.0M 11.3B 2.0x 82.6/81.3 70.1 88.9 92.5 49.0 81.3 86.9 58.4 76.8  \n TinyBERT (ours) 67.0M 11.3B 2.0x  84.6/83.2 71.6 90.4 93.1 51.1 83.7 87.3 70.0 79.4  \n\nTable 1: Results are evaluated on the test set of GLUE official benchmark.

(2018) benchmark, which consists of 2 single-sentence tasks: CoLA\u00a0Warstadt et\u00a0al. (2019), SST-2\u00a0Socher et\u00a0al. (2013), 3 sentence similarity tasks: MRPC\u00a0Dolan and Brockett (2005), STS-B\u00a0Cer et\u00a0al. (2017), QQP\u00a0Chen et\u00a0al. (2018), and 4 natural language inference tasks: MNLI\u00a0Williams et\u00a0al. (2018), QNLI\u00a0Rajpurkar et\u00a0al. (2016), RTE\u00a0Bentivogli et\u00a0al. (2009) and WNLI\u00a0Levesque et\u00a0al. (2012). The metrics for these tasks can be found in the GLUE paper\u00a0Wang et\u00a0al. (2018).\n\n###  4.2 TinyBERT Settings\n\nWe instantiate a tiny student model (the number of layers =4, the hidden size =312, the feed-forward/filter size =1200 and the head number =12) that has a total of 14.5M parameters. This model is referred to as TinyBERT. The original BERT (=12, =768, =3072 and =12) is used as the teacher model that contains 109M parameters. We use as the layer mapping function, so TinyBERT learns from every 3 layers of BERT. The learning weight of each layer is set to 1. Besides, for a direct comparisons with baselines, we also instantiate a TinyBERT\u00a0(=6, =768, =3072 and =12) with the same architecture as BERT-PKD\u00a0Sun et\u00a0al. (2019) and DistilBERT\u00a0Sanh et\u00a0al. (2019).\n\nTinyBERT learning includes the general distillation and the task-specific distillation. For the general distillation, we set the maximum sequence length to 128 and use English Wikipedia (2,500M words) as the text corpus and perform the intermediate layer distillation for 3 epochs with the supervision from a pre-trained BERT and keep other hyper-parameters the same as BERT pre-training\u00a0Devlin et\u00a0al. (2019). For the task-specific distillation, under the supervision of a fine-tuned BERT, we firstly perform intermediate layer distillation on the augmented data for 20 epochs^{4}^{4}4 For large datasets MNLI, QQP, and QNLI, we only perform 10 epochs of the intermediate layer distillation, and for the challenging task CoLA, we perform 50 epochs at this step. with batch size 32 and learning rate 5e-5, and then perform prediction layer distillation on the augmented data\u00a0^{5}^{5}5 For regression task STS-B, the original train set is better. for 3 epochs with choosing the batch size from {16, 32} and learning rate from {1e-5, 2e-5, 3e-5} on dev set. At task-specific distillation, the maximum sequence length is set to 64 for single-sentence tasks, and 128 for sequence pair tasks.\n\n###  4.3 Baselines\n\nWe compare TinyBERT with BERT, BERT^{6}^{6}6https://github.com/google-research/bert\u00a0Turc et\u00a0al.

In this paper, we introduce Flan-MoE, a set of Instruction-Finetuned Sparse Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models. We show that naively finetuning MoE models on a task-specific dataset (in other words, no instruction-finetuning) often yield worse performance compared to dense models of the same computational complexity. However, our Flan-MoE outperforms dense models under multiple experiment settings: instruction-finetuning only and instruction-finetuning followed by task-specific finetuning. This shows that instruction-finetuning is an essential stage for MoE models. Specifically, our largest model, Flan-MoE, surpasses the performance of Flan-PaLM on four benchmarks, while utilizing only one-third of the FLOPs. The success of Flan-MoE encourages rethinking the design of large-scale, high-performance language models, under the setting of task-agnostic learning. \u2020\u2020Work done as a student researcher at Google.\n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nThe recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP), driven by the development of increasingly large and sophisticated deep learning models. Among these models, transformer-based language models \u30100\u2020transformer \u3011 have emerged as the de facto standard for a wide range of NLP tasks, owing to their unparalleled capabilities in capturing complex linguistic patterns and generalizing across diverse contexts. One particularly successful paradigm for training such models is instruction-finetuning\u00a0\u30101\u2020t0 \u3011; \u30102\u2020flan \u3011; \u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011; \u30104\u2020longpre2023flan \u3011; \u30105\u2020bloomz \u3011; \u30106\u2020gptrlhf \u3011, which enhances their performance on specific tasks by adapting their pre-trained representations to follow natural language instructions.\n\nWhile the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) are indisputable, their rapidly growing size and computational requirements pose significant challenges in terms of training efficiency, memory footprint, and deployment costs. Consequently, there is a pressing need for developing scalable techniques that can harness the power of these models without incurring prohibitive computational overheads.\n\nOn the other hands, models with sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (MoEs) significantly reduce the computational cost of LLMs. MoE models build upon the observation that language models can be decomposed into smaller, specialized sub-models, or \"experts\", that focus on distinct aspects of the input data, thereby enabling more efficient computation and resource allocation. However, we show that conventional, task-specific finetuning MoE models lead to suboptimal performance, often even worse than finetuning dense models with the same computational cost. One of the possible reasons is the discrepancy between general pretraining and task-specific finetuning.\n\nIn this paper, we show that finetuning MoEs under a task-agnostic, instruction-finetuning setting is essential for the success of scaling MoEs on downstream tasks, in two ways: First, while it is known that instruction-finetuning improves downstream task-specific finetuning\u00a0\u30104\u2020longpre2023flan \u3011, we show that the improvement is even bigger for MoE models, as opposed to dense models. Second, an instruction-tuning stage is necessary for MoE models to outperform dense models on downstream and held-out tasks. Our MoE instruction finetuned on the Flan mixture\u00a0\u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011, Flan-MoE, successfully combines the strengths of instruction-finetuning and the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique\u00a0\u30107\u2020moe \u3011; \u30108\u2020glam \u3011; \u30109\u2020switchtransformer \u3011; \u301010\u2020gshard \u3011, and scales up language models effectively and efficiently.\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments on a broad array of NLP tasks, including natural language understanding, reasoning, and question answering, to evaluate the performance of Flan-MoE. Our results demonstrate that Flan-MoE significantly outperforms their dense counterparts. Importantly, these gains are achieved without an increase in computational resources or memory requirements. In fact, our largest Flan-MoE can outperform a Flan-PaLM\u00a0counterpart using one third of the compute per token on four different benchmarks. \n\nTo summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWe show that instruction-finetuning is essential for MoE models:\n\n    *  \u2013\n\nWithout instruction tuning, MoE underperforms dense models on downstream tasks.\n\n    *  \u2013\n\nWith instruction tuning, MoE outperforms dense models on downstream tasks, and held-out zero-shot and few-shot tasks. \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments, comparing different MoE models on instruction-finetuning.\n\n##  2 Method\n\n###  2.1 Model Architecture\n\nWe leverage sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\u00a0\u301010\u2020gshard \u3011; \u30109\u2020switchtransformer \u3011; \u301011\u2020expertchoice \u3011 in Flan-MoE models. Similar to the Switch Transformer\u00a0\u30109\u2020switchtransformer \u3011, we replace the feed-forward component of every other Transformer layer with an MoE layer. Each MoE layer consists of a collection of independent feed-forward networks as the \u2018experts\u2019. A gating function then uses a softmax activation function to model a probability distribution over these experts. This distribution indicates how well each expert is able to process the incoming input. Even though each MoE layer has many more parameters, the experts are sparsely activated. This means that for a given input token, only a limited subset of experts is used, giving the model more capacity while limiting computation. In our architecture, the subset size is either one or two depending on the routing strategy. Each MoE layer\u2019s learnable gating network is trained to use its input to activate the best two experts for each token of an input sequence. During inference, the learned gating network dynamically picks the two best experts for each token. For an MoE layer with experts, this essentially provides a collection of different combinations of feed-forward networks instead of one in the classic Transformer architecture, enabling greater computational flexibility. The final learned representation of a token will be the weighted combination of the outputs from the selected experts.\n\n  [Image 0: Refer to caption]   \n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 1: The effect of instruction finetuning on MoE models versus dense counterparts for base-size models (same flops across all models in this figure). We perform single-task finetuning for each model on held-out benchmarks. Compared to dense models, MoE models benefit more from instruction-finetuning, and are more sensitive to the number of instruction-tuning tasks. Overall, the performance of MoE models scales better with respect to the number of tasks, than the number of experts.  \n\n###  2.2 Instruction Fine-tuning Recipe\n\nWe fine-tune Flan-MoE using the prefix language model objective on the FLAN collective dataset\u00a0\u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011; \u30104\u2020longpre2023flan \u3011. Each Flan-MoE will inherit the auxiliary loss setting during pre-training. All the model parameters will be updated. We adapt the sequence length of each Flan-MoE to for input and for output based on the relative position embedding. The dropout rate is and the expert dropout rate is . The learning rate is . The optimizer setting follows\u00a0\u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011.\n\n##  3 Experiment\n\nWe study Flan-MoE in the context of instruction-finetuning. We first perform a controlled comparison of Flan-MoE to an equivalent \u201cstandard\u201d dense encoder-decoder Transformer (T5), across a range of model sizes in Section\u00a0\u301012\u20203.2\u3011. We subsequently demonstrate in Section\u00a0\u301013\u20203.3\u3011 that scaling up our model, referred to as Flan-MoE, can attain remarkable performance levels. Our most extensive model, Flan-ST, surpasses the performance of Flan-PaLM-62B while utilizing less than 30% of FLOPs per token. We further ablate the various design decisions in the next Section.\n\n###  3.1 Settings\n\n#### Traning Data.\n\nBy default, all models are trained on the 1,836 finetuning tasks by combining four mixtures from prior work: Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT, as in \u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011. Specifically, Muffin comprises 80 tasks from \u30102\u2020flan \u3011 and 26 dialog/program synthesis tasks; T0-SF comprises 193 tasks from \u30101\u2020t0 \u3011; NIV2 comprises 1554 tasks from \u301014\u2020naturalinstructions \u3011; CoT comprises 9 reasoning tasks.\n\n#### Evaluations.\n\nWe conduct both zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on held-out tasks as in \u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011 which were not included as part of the finetuning data. We use MMLU \u301015\u2020mmlu \u3011 that includes exam questions from 57 tasks such as mathematics, history, law, and medicine; BBH includes 23 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench \u301016\u2020bigbench \u3011; The reasoning benchmark comprises four tasks: GSM8K\u00a0\u301017\u2020gsm8k \u3011 and SVAMP\u00a0\u301018\u2020svamp \u3011/ASDIV\u00a0\u301019\u2020asdiv \u3011 incorporate the grade school math word problems and the elementary-level math word problems, and StrategyQA\u00a0\u301020\u2020strategyqa \u3011 measures open-domain questions where the required reasoning steps are implicit in the question; The QA benchmark include four QA tasks: the elementary AI2 science category in UnifiedQA\u00a0\u301021\u2020unifiedqa \u3011, BoolQ\u00a0\u301022\u2020boolq \u3011, ARC-easy and ARC-challenge\u00a0\u301023\u2020arc \u3011 that covers QA tasks in abstract, yes/no, multiple-choice formats. For MMLU and BBH, we evaluate both the ability of directly predicting the answer via direct prompting, where the model directly gives the answer\u00a0\u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011, as well as via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, where the model must provide a reasoning chain before giving the final answer\u00a0\u301024\u2020wei2022chain \u3011. For reasoning tasks, we only measure CoT prompting accuracy. For all benchmarks except for QA we use the given few-shot exemplars, with the number of exemplars following prior work: five-shot for MMLU, three-shot for BBH, eight-shot for reasoning tasks, and zero-shot for QA. For a given model we also report a single \u201cnormalized average\u201d metric, following the \u201cnormalized preferred metric\u201d in BIG-Bench \u301016\u2020bigbench \u3011. Our normalized average metric is the macro-average over four normalized scores: MMLU-Direct, BBH-Direct, Reasoning-CoT, and QA-Direct. Results for all tasks in each benchmark are reported in Appendix.\n\n###  3.2 Controlled study across scales\n\n   [Image 3: Refer to caption]   \n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 2: Average zero performance of Flan-MoE models versus Flan-T5 dense models for similar effective FLOPs per token over the 57 MMLU tasks and 23 BBH tasks.^{2}^{2}2 We use 64 experts for small, base, 32b, xl and 128 experts for all the other model sizes following\u00a0\u30109\u2020switchtransformer \u3011; \u301011\u2020expertchoice \u3011; \u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011\n\nWe instruction finetune a range of Flan-MoE models at batch size 32 and sequence length 2048 for 200k steps. This matches the number of training examples used for Flan-T5\u00a0\u30103\u2020flant5 \u3011. We re-finetuning our own Flan-T5 variants for fair comparisons. \n\n#### Dense Model Size.\n\nFigure\u00a02 shows the performance of each model (dense and sparse) against forward-pass FLOPs. The cost-performance Pareto frontier for Flan-MoE dominates the dense models by a wide margin, indicating that Flan-MoE offers strong improvements across all scales from small, up to xxl. The effect is particularly large on zero-shot and few-shot MMLU-Direct, with absolute performance improvements of 7.1% on average. For challenging tasks in BBH-Direct, Flan-MoE offers a strong boost at small scales, while at larger scales the gains are more modest but still significant.\n\n#### Expert Number.\n\nThe performance of Flan-MoE models has been observed to scale with the number of experts included in the architecture, but it tends to saturate beyond a certain threshold. Initially, as the number of experts increases in Figure\u00a0\u301026\u20204\u3011, the model benefits from a richer repertoire of specialized sub-networks, each capable of handling distinct tasks or aspects of the problem space. This diverse ensemble enables the MoE model to demonstrate enhanced adaptability and efficiency in processing complex tasks, leading to improved performance overall. However, as the number of experts continues to grow, the performance gains begin to diminish, eventually reaching a point of saturation for base-sized model.\n\n#### Routing Strategy\n\nRouting strategy is an essential component of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, playing a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of these models. The primary function of the routing strategy is to intelligently distribute input data among multiple specialized experts, each optimized for handling specific subsets of the input space. This distribution process is crucial for maximizing the utilization of the model\u2019s capacity while minimizing the risk of overfitting. An effective routing strategy not only ensures that the appropriate experts are selected for a given input, but also that resources are allocated optimally, leading to enhanced computational efficiency and faster training times. Consequently, there have been two trending strategies, token-choice\u00a0\u301010\u2020gshard \u3011 which lets the token select the top- experts, and expert-choice\u00a0\u301011\u2020expertchoice \u3011 which lets the experts select the top- tokens. \n\nWe presented a detailed study about how different routing decisions affect the instruct fine-tuning performance in Figure\u00a0\u301027\u20203\u3011 and Table\u00a0\u301028\u20201\u3011, which includes the checkpoints from Switch Transformer top-1 token-choice gating (Flan-Switch), GShard top-2 token-choice gating (Flan-GS) and expert-choice top-2 gating (Flan-EC) models pre-trained on the same GLaM\u00a0\u30108\u2020glam \u3011 dataset. It is evident that activating more experts, as demonstrated by the comparison between the Flan-Switch and Flan-GS strategies, results in enhanced performance across all four benchmarks. Among these benchmarks, the MMLU-Direct model shows the most significant improvement, with an increase from 38.0% to 39.9% for base/large-sized models. Although the gains at the extra-large scale are more modest, they remain noteworthy and meaningful.\n\nFurthermore, the Flan-EC strategy consistently outshines the Flan-GS approach for the given model across various scales and tasks. It is noteworthy that the performance gap between the token-choice and expert-choice models can be bridged when we incorporate advanced auxiliary loss and pre-training strategy as exhibited in ST-MoE\u00a0\u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011. This integration led to the development of our Flan-ST models. Considering that the largest ST-MoE set the benchmark in a variety of NLP tasks when appropriately fine-tuned, we have also decided to scale up Flan-ST, employing instruction fine-tuning. \n\n[Image 6: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 7: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 3:  Learning efficiency comparison.

(Different color represents different dense model sizes.)  \n\n###  3.3 Scaling up Flan-MoE\n\nWe increase the architecture size to assess the performance of Flan-MoE in the large-scale regime. As discussed above, we instruction fine-tune the largest ST-MoE\u00a0\u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011 model with 12 expert layers in encoder, and decoder, respectively; these are non-uniformly distributed, with 64 experts per layer, and activated per token. It was trained at a batch size of 32 and sequence length of 2048 for 200k steps. We average checkpoints towards the end of training. The model Flan-ST, comprising a total of 32 billion parameters, only utilizes 32.1 GFLOPs per token, which amounts to merely one-third of the computational power required by a Flan-PaLM model. Additionally, all the routers combined account for less than 4 million parameters. Table\u00a0\u301028\u20201\u3011 illustrates the performance of this model alongside current state-of-the-art instruct fine-tuned models.\n\nFlan-ST achieves a 65.4% few-shot MMLU benchmark accuracy and a 54.4% few-shot BBH benchmark accuracy, with a relatively modest architectural size and training count. Notably, Flan-ST surpasses the performance of PaLM, which consumes nearly triple the compute resources, by a substantial margin across all four benchmarks. However, it is important to acknowledge the considerable performance gap that persists between the largest Flan-PaLM and Flan-ST models. \n\n  Model FLOPs Total MMLU BBH Reasoning QA Norm.

Instruction finetuning can also be viewed as a continual finetuning stage, so we present a detailed study about how different factors impact the instruct finetuning performance of Flan-MoE and offer a practical recipe. All the discussion here is based on instruction finetuning Flan-EC/Flan-ST for 100k steps.\n\n[Image 12: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 13: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 5: Average few-shot performance of Flan-MoE with different finetuning strategy.  \n\n#### Auxiliary Loss.\n\nThe incorporation of auxiliary loss\u00a0\u301010\u2020gshard \u3011; \u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011 helps mitigate the risk of overfitting by promoting the diversification of the experts\u2019 knowledge and improving the model\u2019s generalization capabilities for sparsely gated mixture-of-expert models. Furthermore, auxiliary losses can be employed to address specific issues, such as load balancing among experts or preventing expert collapse, which can further enhance the model\u2019s overall performance. We experiment with both balancing loss that is used in\u00a0\u301010\u2020gshard \u3011 and router Z-loss that is used in\u00a0\u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011 in Table\u00a0\u301029\u20202\u3011. The implementation of balancing loss contributed to enhanced performance on MMLU, BBH, and GSM8K for Flan-ECbase, whereas Z-loss resulted in a deterioration of performance. Conversely, for Flan-STbase, we observed a contrasting trend. We conjecture that the discordance between the auxiliary loss during pre-training and instruction-finetuning could potentially disrupt the optimization process, thereby leading to a suboptimally optimized Flan-MoE model. \n\n#### Expert/Gating Freeze.\n\nIn an effort to enhance the generalization capabilities of sparse models and combat overfitting, researchers have discovered that finetuning a subset of model parameters results in improved generalization performance for ST-MoE models, as noted in the study by ST-MoE\u00a0\u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011. Interestingly, it was observed that updating non-MoE parameters yields similar outcomes to updating all parameters, while updating only expert parameters performs slightly better.\n\nWe conducted experiments by freezing the gating function, expert modules, and MoE parameters of the given model, as presented in Table\u00a0\u301029\u20202\u3011. The results indicate that freezing either the expert or MoE components negatively impacts performance. Conversely, freezing the gate slightly improves performance, albeit not significantly. We postulate that this observation is related to the under-fitting of the Flan-MoE, as in Figure\u00a0\u301030\u20205\u3011, which depicts the finetuning data efficiency ablation study.\n\n   Finetuning   MMLU  BBH GSM8K Avg.  \n Strategy Direct Direct CoT  \n Baseline  40.0 33.2 6.6 37.7  \n Freeze-Gate  40.2 33.9 6.6 38.0  \n Freeze-Expert  38.3 32.5 5.4 36.2  \n Freeze-MoE  38.4 32.2 5.3 36.2  \n Z-loss  38.9 32.8 5.7 36.8  \n Balance-loss  40.8 33.4 7.1 38.3  \n\n   Finetuning   MMLU  BBH GSM8K Avg.  \n Strategy Direct Direct CoT  \n Baseline  40.1 33.3 6.4 37.8  \n Freeze-Gate  40.6 33.5 6.4 38.2  \n Freeze-Expert  39.6 32.9 4.5 37.3  \n Freeze-MoE  39.2 32.9 3.6 36.9  \n Z-loss  40.6 33.4 6.5 38.1  \n Balance-loss  38.8 31.3 3.6 36.2  \n\nTable 2: Ablations on different finetuning strategies of Flan-EC and Flan-ST.   \n\n#### Hyperparameter Sensitivity.\n\nFollowing ST-MoE\u00a0\u301025\u2020stmoe \u3011, we further experiment with expert dropout (), varying the learning rate () and batch size () to examine the hyperparameter sensitivity of Flan-MoE. We found that the performance varies in different tasks but not significantly with all the hyperparameters, but lower learning rate and small batch size lead to a more stable instruction finetuning process of the model at extra-large scales.\n\n#### Finetuning v.s.

In this paper, we introduce Flan-MoE, a set of Instruction-Finetuned Sparse Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models. We show that naively finetuning MoE models on a task-specific dataset (in other words, no instruction-finetuning) often yield worse performance compared to dense models of the same computational complexity. However, our Flan-MoE outperforms dense models under multiple experiment settings: instruction-finetuning only and instruction-finetuning followed by task-specific finetuning. This shows that instruction-finetuning is an essential stage for MoE models. Specifically, our largest model, Flan-MoE, surpasses the performance of Flan-PaLM on four benchmarks, while utilizing only one-third of the FLOPs. The success of Flan-MoE encourages rethinking the design of large-scale, high-performance language models, under the setting of task-agnostic learning. \u2020\u2020Work done as a student researcher at Google.\n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nThe recent years have witnessed remarkable advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP), driven by the development of increasingly large and sophisticated deep learning models. Among these models, transformer-based language models transformer  have emerged as the de facto standard for a wide range of NLP tasks, owing to their unparalleled capabilities in capturing complex linguistic patterns and generalizing across diverse contexts. One particularly successful paradigm for training such models is instruction-finetuning\u00a0t0 ; flan ; flant5 ; longpre2023flan ; bloomz ; gptrlhf , which enhances their performance on specific tasks by adapting their pre-trained representations to follow natural language instructions.\n\nWhile the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) are indisputable, their rapidly growing size and computational requirements pose significant challenges in terms of training efficiency, memory footprint, and deployment costs. Consequently, there is a pressing need for developing scalable techniques that can harness the power of these models without incurring prohibitive computational overheads.\n\nOn the other hands, models with sparsely activated Mixture of Experts (MoEs) significantly reduce the computational cost of LLMs. MoE models build upon the observation that language models can be decomposed into smaller, specialized sub-models, or \"experts\", that focus on distinct aspects of the input data, thereby enabling more efficient computation and resource allocation. However, we show that conventional, task-specific finetuning MoE models lead to suboptimal performance, often even worse than finetuning dense models with the same computational cost. One of the possible reasons is the discrepancy between general pretraining and task-specific finetuning.\n\nIn this paper, we show that finetuning MoEs under a task-agnostic, instruction-finetuning setting is essential for the success of scaling MoEs on downstream tasks, in two ways: First, while it is known that instruction-finetuning improves downstream task-specific finetuning\u00a0longpre2023flan , we show that the improvement is even bigger for MoE models, as opposed to dense models. Second, an instruction-tuning stage is necessary for MoE models to outperform dense models on downstream and held-out tasks. Our MoE instruction finetuned on the Flan mixture\u00a0flant5 , Flan-MoE, successfully combines the strengths of instruction-finetuning and the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique\u00a0moe ; glam ; switchtransformer ; gshard , and scales up language models effectively and efficiently.\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments on a broad array of NLP tasks, including natural language understanding, reasoning, and question answering, to evaluate the performance of Flan-MoE. Our results demonstrate that Flan-MoE significantly outperforms their dense counterparts. Importantly, these gains are achieved without an increase in computational resources or memory requirements. In fact, our largest Flan-MoE can outperform a Flan-PaLM\u00a0counterpart using one third of the compute per token on four different benchmarks. \n\nTo summarize, our contributions are as follows:\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWe show that instruction-finetuning is essential for MoE models:\n\n    *  \u2013\n\nWithout instruction tuning, MoE underperforms dense models on downstream tasks.\n\n    *  \u2013\n\nWith instruction tuning, MoE outperforms dense models on downstream tasks, and held-out zero-shot and few-shot tasks. \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWe conduct extensive experiments, comparing different MoE models on instruction-finetuning.\n\n##  2 Method\n\n###  2.1 Model Architecture\n\nWe leverage sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\u00a0gshard ; switchtransformer ; expertchoice  in Flan-MoE models. Similar to the Switch Transformer\u00a0switchtransformer , we replace the feed-forward component of every other Transformer layer with an MoE layer. Each MoE layer consists of a collection of independent feed-forward networks as the \u2018experts\u2019. A gating function then uses a softmax activation function to model a probability distribution over these experts. This distribution indicates how well each expert is able to process the incoming input. Even though each MoE layer has many more parameters, the experts are sparsely activated. This means that for a given input token, only a limited subset of experts is used, giving the model more capacity while limiting computation. In our architecture, the subset size is either one or two depending on the routing strategy. Each MoE layer\u2019s learnable gating network is trained to use its input to activate the best two experts for each token of an input sequence. During inference, the learned gating network dynamically picks the two best experts for each token. For an MoE layer with experts, this essentially provides a collection of different combinations of feed-forward networks instead of one in the classic Transformer architecture, enabling greater computational flexibility. The final learned representation of a token will be the weighted combination of the outputs from the selected experts.\n\n  [Image 0: Refer to caption]   \n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 1: The effect of instruction finetuning on MoE models versus dense counterparts for base-size models (same flops across all models in this figure). We perform single-task finetuning for each model on held-out benchmarks. Compared to dense models, MoE models benefit more from instruction-finetuning, and are more sensitive to the number of instruction-tuning tasks. Overall, the performance of MoE models scales better with respect to the number of tasks, than the number of experts.  \n\n###  2.2 Instruction Fine-tuning Recipe\n\nWe fine-tune Flan-MoE using the prefix language model objective on the FLAN collective dataset\u00a0flant5 ; longpre2023flan . Each Flan-MoE will inherit the auxiliary loss setting during pre-training. All the model parameters will be updated. We adapt the sequence length of each Flan-MoE to for input and for output based on the relative position embedding. The dropout rate is and the expert dropout rate is . The learning rate is . The optimizer setting follows\u00a0flant5 .\n\n##  3 Experiment\n\nWe study Flan-MoE in the context of instruction-finetuning. We first perform a controlled comparison of Flan-MoE to an equivalent \u201cstandard\u201d dense encoder-decoder Transformer (T5), across a range of model sizes in Section\u00a03.2. We subsequently demonstrate in Section\u00a03.3 that scaling up our model, referred to as Flan-MoE, can attain remarkable performance levels. Our most extensive model, Flan-ST, surpasses the performance of Flan-PaLM-62B while utilizing less than 30% of FLOPs per token. We further ablate the various design decisions in the next Section.\n\n###  3.1 Settings\n\n#### Traning Data.\n\nBy default, all models are trained on the 1,836 finetuning tasks by combining four mixtures from prior work: Muffin, T0-SF, NIV2, and CoT, as in flant5 . Specifically, Muffin comprises 80 tasks from flan  and 26 dialog/program synthesis tasks; T0-SF comprises 193 tasks from t0 ; NIV2 comprises 1554 tasks from naturalinstructions ; CoT comprises 9 reasoning tasks.\n\n#### Evaluations.\n\nWe conduct both zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on held-out tasks as in flant5  which were not included as part of the finetuning data. We use MMLU mmlu  that includes exam questions from 57 tasks such as mathematics, history, law, and medicine; BBH includes 23 challenging tasks from BIG-Bench bigbench ; The reasoning benchmark comprises four tasks: GSM8K\u00a0gsm8k  and SVAMP\u00a0svamp /ASDIV\u00a0asdiv  incorporate the grade school math word problems and the elementary-level math word problems, and StrategyQA\u00a0strategyqa  measures open-domain questions where the required reasoning steps are implicit in the question; The QA benchmark include four QA tasks: the elementary AI2 science category in UnifiedQA\u00a0unifiedqa , BoolQ\u00a0boolq , ARC-easy and ARC-challenge\u00a0arc  that covers QA tasks in abstract, yes/no, multiple-choice formats. For MMLU and BBH, we evaluate both the ability of directly predicting the answer via direct prompting, where the model directly gives the answer\u00a0flant5 , as well as via chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, where the model must provide a reasoning chain before giving the final answer\u00a0wei2022chain . For reasoning tasks, we only measure CoT prompting accuracy. For all benchmarks except for QA we use the given few-shot exemplars, with the number of exemplars following prior work: five-shot for MMLU, three-shot for BBH, eight-shot for reasoning tasks, and zero-shot for QA. For a given model we also report a single \u201cnormalized average\u201d metric, following the \u201cnormalized preferred metric\u201d in BIG-Bench bigbench . Our normalized average metric is the macro-average over four normalized scores: MMLU-Direct, BBH-Direct, Reasoning-CoT, and QA-Direct. Results for all tasks in each benchmark are reported in Appendix.\n\n###  3.2 Controlled study across scales\n\n   [Image 3: Refer to caption]   \n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 2: Average zero performance of Flan-MoE models versus Flan-T5 dense models for similar effective FLOPs per token over the 57 MMLU tasks and 23 BBH tasks.^{2}^{2}2 We use 64 experts for small, base, 32b, xl and 128 experts for all the other model sizes following\u00a0switchtransformer ; expertchoice ; stmoe \n\nWe instruction finetune a range of Flan-MoE models at batch size 32 and sequence length 2048 for 200k steps. This matches the number of training examples used for Flan-T5\u00a0flant5 . We re-finetuning our own Flan-T5 variants for fair comparisons. \n\n#### Dense Model Size.\n\nFigure\u00a02 shows the performance of each model (dense and sparse) against forward-pass FLOPs. The cost-performance Pareto frontier for Flan-MoE dominates the dense models by a wide margin, indicating that Flan-MoE offers strong improvements across all scales from small, up to xxl. The effect is particularly large on zero-shot and few-shot MMLU-Direct, with absolute performance improvements of 7.1% on average. For challenging tasks in BBH-Direct, Flan-MoE offers a strong boost at small scales, while at larger scales the gains are more modest but still significant.\n\n#### Expert Number.\n\nThe performance of Flan-MoE models has been observed to scale with the number of experts included in the architecture, but it tends to saturate beyond a certain threshold. Initially, as the number of experts increases in Figure\u00a04, the model benefits from a richer repertoire of specialized sub-networks, each capable of handling distinct tasks or aspects of the problem space. This diverse ensemble enables the MoE model to demonstrate enhanced adaptability and efficiency in processing complex tasks, leading to improved performance overall. However, as the number of experts continues to grow, the performance gains begin to diminish, eventually reaching a point of saturation for base-sized model.\n\n#### Routing Strategy\n\nRouting strategy is an essential component of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, playing a pivotal role in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of these models. The primary function of the routing strategy is to intelligently distribute input data among multiple specialized experts, each optimized for handling specific subsets of the input space. This distribution process is crucial for maximizing the utilization of the model\u2019s capacity while minimizing the risk of overfitting. An effective routing strategy not only ensures that the appropriate experts are selected for a given input, but also that resources are allocated optimally, leading to enhanced computational efficiency and faster training times. Consequently, there have been two trending strategies, token-choice\u00a0gshard  which lets the token select the top- experts, and expert-choice\u00a0expertchoice  which lets the experts select the top- tokens. \n\nWe presented a detailed study about how different routing decisions affect the instruct fine-tuning performance in Figure\u00a03 and Table\u00a01, which includes the checkpoints from Switch Transformer top-1 token-choice gating (Flan-Switch), GShard top-2 token-choice gating (Flan-GS) and expert-choice top-2 gating (Flan-EC) models pre-trained on the same GLaM\u00a0glam  dataset. It is evident that activating more experts, as demonstrated by the comparison between the Flan-Switch and Flan-GS strategies, results in enhanced performance across all four benchmarks. Among these benchmarks, the MMLU-Direct model shows the most significant improvement, with an increase from 38.0% to 39.9% for base/large-sized models. Although the gains at the extra-large scale are more modest, they remain noteworthy and meaningful.\n\nFurthermore, the Flan-EC strategy consistently outshines the Flan-GS approach for the given model across various scales and tasks. It is noteworthy that the performance gap between the token-choice and expert-choice models can be bridged when we incorporate advanced auxiliary loss and pre-training strategy as exhibited in ST-MoE\u00a0stmoe . This integration led to the development of our Flan-ST models. Considering that the largest ST-MoE set the benchmark in a variety of NLP tasks when appropriately fine-tuned, we have also decided to scale up Flan-ST, employing instruction fine-tuning. \n\n[Image 6: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 7: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 3:  Learning efficiency comparison.

(Different color represents different dense model sizes.)  \n\n###  3.3 Scaling up Flan-MoE\n\nWe increase the architecture size to assess the performance of Flan-MoE in the large-scale regime. As discussed above, we instruction fine-tune the largest ST-MoE\u00a0stmoe  model with 12 expert layers in encoder, and decoder, respectively; these are non-uniformly distributed, with 64 experts per layer, and activated per token. It was trained at a batch size of 32 and sequence length of 2048 for 200k steps. We average checkpoints towards the end of training. The model Flan-ST, comprising a total of 32 billion parameters, only utilizes 32.1 GFLOPs per token, which amounts to merely one-third of the computational power required by a Flan-PaLM model. Additionally, all the routers combined account for less than 4 million parameters. Table\u00a01 illustrates the performance of this model alongside current state-of-the-art instruct fine-tuned models.\n\nFlan-ST achieves a 65.4% few-shot MMLU benchmark accuracy and a 54.4% few-shot BBH benchmark accuracy, with a relatively modest architectural size and training count. Notably, Flan-ST surpasses the performance of PaLM, which consumes nearly triple the compute resources, by a substantial margin across all four benchmarks. However, it is important to acknowledge the considerable performance gap that persists between the largest Flan-PaLM and Flan-ST models. \n\n  Model FLOPs Total MMLU BBH Reasoning QA Norm.

The benchmark suites are MMLU (57 tasks), BBH (23 tasks), Reasoning (4 Tasks), and QA (4 Tasks). The evaluation metric across all benchmarks is few-shot prompted accuracy, specifically the exact match. To calculate this metric, we take an unweighted average across all tasks. For a comprehensive evaluation, we report the normalized average of MMLU-direct, BBH-direct, Reasoning-CoT, and QA-Direct. The MMLU and BBH evaluation benchmarks are held-out (not included in the finetuning data.) while the Reasoning and QA evaluation benchmarks are held-in. (Noted that Flan-ST outperforms Flan-PaLM while being <30% of the FLOPS.)   \n\n##  4 Discussion\n\n###  4.1 Finetuing Strategy\n\nSparse models have performed remarkably well in the regime of large datasets, but have sometimes performed poorly when finetuning data is limited\u00a0stmoe ; switchtransformer . Instruction finetuning can also be viewed as a continual finetuning stage, so we present a detailed study about how different factors impact the instruct finetuning performance of Flan-MoE and offer a practical recipe. All the discussion here is based on instruction finetuning Flan-EC/Flan-ST for 100k steps.\n\n[Image 12: Refer to caption] \n\n[Image 13: Refer to caption] \n\nFigure 5: Average few-shot performance of Flan-MoE with different finetuning strategy.  \n\n#### Auxiliary Loss.\n\nThe incorporation of auxiliary loss\u00a0gshard ; stmoe  helps mitigate the risk of overfitting by promoting the diversification of the experts\u2019 knowledge and improving the model\u2019s generalization capabilities for sparsely gated mixture-of-expert models. Furthermore, auxiliary losses can be employed to address specific issues, such as load balancing among experts or preventing expert collapse, which can further enhance the model\u2019s overall performance. We experiment with both balancing loss that is used in\u00a0gshard  and router Z-loss that is used in\u00a0stmoe  in Table\u00a02. The implementation of balancing loss contributed to enhanced performance on MMLU, BBH, and GSM8K for Flan-ECbase, whereas Z-loss resulted in a deterioration of performance. Conversely, for Flan-STbase, we observed a contrasting trend. We conjecture that the discordance between the auxiliary loss during pre-training and instruction-finetuning could potentially disrupt the optimization process, thereby leading to a suboptimally optimized Flan-MoE model. \n\n#### Expert/Gating Freeze.\n\nIn an effort to enhance the generalization capabilities of sparse models and combat overfitting, researchers have discovered that finetuning a subset of model parameters results in improved generalization performance for ST-MoE models, as noted in the study by ST-MoE\u00a0stmoe . Interestingly, it was observed that updating non-MoE parameters yields similar outcomes to updating all parameters, while updating only expert parameters performs slightly better.\n\nWe conducted experiments by freezing the gating function, expert modules, and MoE parameters of the given model, as presented in Table\u00a02. The results indicate that freezing either the expert or MoE components negatively impacts performance. Conversely, freezing the gate slightly improves performance, albeit not significantly. We postulate that this observation is related to the under-fitting of the Flan-MoE, as in Figure\u00a05, which depicts the finetuning data efficiency ablation study.\n\n   Finetuning   MMLU  BBH GSM8K Avg.  \n Strategy Direct Direct CoT  \n Baseline  40.0 33.2 6.6 37.7  \n Freeze-Gate  40.2 33.9 6.6 38.0  \n Freeze-Expert  38.3 32.5 5.4 36.2  \n Freeze-MoE  38.4 32.2 5.3 36.2  \n Z-loss  38.9 32.8 5.7 36.8  \n Balance-loss  40.8 33.4 7.1 38.3  \n\n   Finetuning   MMLU  BBH GSM8K Avg.  \n Strategy Direct Direct CoT  \n Baseline  40.1 33.3 6.4 37.8  \n Freeze-Gate  40.6 33.5 6.4 38.2  \n Freeze-Expert  39.6 32.9 4.5 37.3  \n Freeze-MoE  39.2 32.9 3.6 36.9  \n Z-loss  40.6 33.4 6.5 38.1  \n Balance-loss  38.8 31.3 3.6 36.2  \n\nTable 2: Ablations on different finetuning strategies of Flan-EC and Flan-ST.   \n\n#### Hyperparameter Sensitivity.\n\nFollowing ST-MoE\u00a0stmoe , we further experiment with expert dropout (), varying the learning rate () and batch size () to examine the hyperparameter sensitivity of Flan-MoE. We found that the performance varies in different tasks but not significantly with all the hyperparameters, but lower learning rate and small batch size lead to a more stable instruction finetuning process of the model at extra-large scales.\n\n#### Finetuning v.s. Instruction Finetuning.\n\nTo compare the gap between finetuning MoE directly and Flan-MoE, we experiment with single-task finetuned MoE, single-task finetuned Flan-MoE, and\nVisible: 0% - 18%", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "open_url", "args": ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14705.pdf"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "da27ea45-58de-4c09-915a-f56466bade98", "request_id": "851458ede8ed3cf2-CDG", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "da27ea45-58de-4c09-915a-f56466bade98", "children": ["4832ba89-5715-476b-a3cc-1380fe1e3178"]}, "4832ba89-5715-476b-a3cc-1380fe1e3178": {"id": "4832ba89-5715-476b-a3cc-1380fe1e3178", "message": {"id": "4832ba89-5715-476b-a3cc-1380fe1e3178", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1707232537.051326, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["- [Flan-MoE: Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14705.pdf)\n\nThe paper introduces Flan-MoE, a model that effectively scales instruction-finetuned language models using Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) to outperform dense models in various benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Semnani Violet Z. Yao Heidi C. Zhang Monica S. Lam   \nComputer Science Department   \nStanford University   \nStanford, CA   \n{sinaj, vyao, chenyuz, lam}@cs.stanford.edu\n\n###### Abstract\n\nDespite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), users still cannot trust the information provided in their responses. LLMs cannot speak accurately about events that occurred after their training, which are often topics of great interest to users, and, as we show in this paper, they are highly prone to hallucination when talking about less popular (tail) topics.\n\nThis paper presents WikiChat, a few-shot LLM-based chatbot that is grounded with live information from Wikipedia. Through many iterations of experimentation, we have crafted a pipeline based on information retrieval that (1) uses LLMs to suggest interesting and relevant facts that are individually verified against Wikipedia, (2) retrieves additional up-to-date information, and (3) composes coherent and engaging time-aware responses.\n\nWe propose a novel hybrid human-and-LLM evaluation methodology to analyze the factuality and conversationality of LLM-based chatbots. We focus on evaluating important but previously neglected issues such as conversing about recent and tail topics.\n\nWe evaluate WikiChat against strong fine-tuned and LLM-based baselines across a diverse set of conversation topics. We find that WikiChat outperforms all baselines in terms of the factual accuracy of its claims, by up to 12.1%, 28.3% and 32.7% on head, recent and tail topics, while matching GPT-3.5 in terms of providing natural, relevant, non-repetitive and informational responses.\n\n**footnotetext: Equal contribution  \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: All WikiChat components, and a sample conversation, edited for brevity. The steps taken to generate a response include 1) retrieval from Wikipedia, 2) summarizing and filtering the retrieved passages, 3) generating a response from an LLM, 4) extracting factual claims from the LLM response 5) fact-checking the claims in the LLM response, 6) drafting a response, and 7) refining the response.\n\nLarge language models have garnered a lot of interest from consumers because of their command of language as well as their broad skill set and knowledge. While they are very helpful as a task tool (e.g. writing an email or generating ideas) where the users have ultimate control over the final result, they are lacking as chatbots that end-users converse with to explore and learn more about what they find interesting, or to satisfy an information need. In this paper we argue that there are two major problems when using LLMs in this setting: that they cannot speak accurately about events that occurred after their pre-training (which are often the topics of interest), and are far less knowledgeable about less popular topics. Yet, they are prone to generating confident but misleading information (or hallucination). If a user of today\u2019s numerous chatbots wants to learn more about their favorite local music band or the latest book their favorite author wrote, they need to carefully and painstakingly verify any information they receive with external sources lest they be misled.\n\nIn this paper, we tackle knowledge-grounded conversations, where the main goal is to provide only trusted knowledge to users. We assume access to a source of trusted knowledge in the form of a text corpus, for instance the English Wikipedia. We refer to this desirable property of chatbots as factuality. As we show in our evaluation, some chatbots achieve this by presenting factual but unrelated and repetitive information, which is not helpful for users. Therefore, we emphasize that conversationality is also important.\n\nInformation retrieval (IR) has been shown to be an effective addition to language models on several knowledge-intensive tasks\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (\u30100\u20202020\u3011); Shuster et\u00a0al. (\u30101\u20202021a\u3011). However, existing methods either do not evaluate on conversations at all\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (\u30100\u20202020\u3011); Trivedi et\u00a0al. (\u30102\u20202022\u3011) and entirely ignore the conversationality part, or limit themselves to fact-checking LLM outputs\u00a0Gao et\u00a0al. (\u30103\u20202022\u3011); Jiang et\u00a0al. (\u30104\u20202023\u3011). Only fact-checking LLM outputs means that by design, they cannot access knowledge about recent events, since the starting point is the LLM which has no knowledge of recent events. Moreover, some require changes to the pre-training process\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (\u30100\u20202020\u3011); Guu et\u00a0al. (\u30105\u20202020\u3011) of language models, which incur a heavy computational cost.\n\nWe posit that current LLMs, with their general-purpose pre-training and instruction-tuning\u00a0Ouyang et\u00a0al. (\u30106\u20202022\u3011), have reached a level of quality that a carefully designed set of few-shot subtasks, that incorporate information retrieval at the right places, can address these issues. As such, we propose the first fully few-shot chatbot that provides up-to-date and fact-checked information in engaging conversations. \n\nOn the evaluation side, most chatbots are evaluated only on static crowdsourced benchmarks like Wizard of Wikipedia\u00a0Dinan et\u00a0al. (\u30107\u20202019\u3011) and Wizard of Internet\u00a0Komeili et\u00a0al. (\u30108\u20202022\u3011). Even when human evaluation is used, evaluation is conducted only on familiar discussion topics. This leads to an overestimation of the capabilities of chatbots. We propose a methodology to effectively test knowledge-based chatbots on a set of carefully chosen conversation topics with the help of user simulation, and human and automatic evaluation.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWikiChat, a few-shot chatbot that takes the best abilities of LLMs (which are highly conversational and good at piecing together information from the stored knowledge in their weights) and significantly improves its trustworthiness with the use of information retrieval. Designed to chat about any and all topics in Wikipedia, WikiChat has a carefully crafted 7-stage pipeline of few-shot prompted LLM as shown in Figure\u00a01.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nAn improved simulation-based benchmark design with a hybrid human-and-LLM evaluation technique. This helps circumvent the limitations of existing benchmarks, and for instance enables us to easily evaluate chatbots on any topic, including tail and recent topics, instead of having to stick with the ones that human annotators are familiar with.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWe show that WikiChat significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of factuality (24.4% better than GPT-3.5 on average) and conversationality (21.9% better than Atlas on average). We quantify the large gap in conversationality between models that use and do not use LLMs, and show how much LLMs struggle on tail and recent topics.\n\n##  2 Related Work\n\n###  2.1 Factuality of Large Language Models\n\nTo address the hallucination issues of LLMs, retrieval augmented generation methods Li et\u00a0al. (\u30109\u20202022\u3011) have been used to improve the factuality of LLMs by integrating retrieved knowledge. Moreover, researchers have utilized fact-checking methods to verify and correct LLM outputs. Gao et\u00a0al. (\u30103\u20202022\u3011) use query generation and evidence retrieval to attribute LLM outputs, and apply chain-of-thought prompting Wei et\u00a0al. (\u301010\u20202022\u3011) to post-edit LLM outputs, ensuring consistency with external evidence. While useful for certain tasks, this strict definition of fact-checking (meaning that it needs to correct and output everything the base LLM generates) is not a good fit for knowledge-grounded conversations. In our design, we allow our chatbot to choose what to say; for example, if our fact-checking system is unsure about a certain claim, the chatbot can simply not say it.\n\nConcurrent with our work, Zhao et\u00a0al. (\u301011\u20202023\u3011) refine reasoning chains using external knowledge, thereby enhancing the factuality of chain-of-thought prompting in knowledge-intensive tasks. Peng et\u00a0al. (\u301012\u20202023\u3011) augment LLMs by grounding responses in task-specific databases and iteratively refining prompts using utility functions, including factuality scores.\n\n###  2.2 Knowledge-Grounded Chatbots\n\nIn the chatbot space, neural-retrieval-in-the-loop architectures have been used to develop knowledge-grounded chatbots with the goal of reducing hallucination \u00a0Shuster et\u00a0al. (\u301013\u20202021b\u3011). BlenderBot 2 Chen et\u00a0al. (\u301014\u20202021\u3011) builds upon BlenderBot 1 Roller et\u00a0al. (\u301015\u20202020\u3011) by allowing the bot to incorporate information retrieved from the Internet for Wizard of the Internet Komeili et\u00a0al. (\u301016\u20202021\u3011). SeeKeR Shuster et\u00a0al. (\u301017\u20202022a\u3011) outperforms BlenderBot 2 Chen et\u00a0al. (\u301014\u20202021\u3011) in open-domain knowledge-grounded conversations by utilizing a single language model for three modular tasks: generating search queries based on the input context, producing relevant knowledge responses using retrieved documents, and combining them with the input context to generate the final response.\n\nBlenderBot 3 Shuster et\u00a0al. (\u301018\u20202022b\u3011) further improves the model by fine-tuning a 175B-parameter OPT\u00a0Zhang et\u00a0al. (\u301019\u20202022\u3011) on several dialogue datasets, including several question answering and dialogue datasets like Wizard of Wikipedia\u00a0Dinan et\u00a0al. (\u30107\u20202019\u3011) and Wizard of Internet\u00a0Komeili et\u00a0al. (\u30108\u20202022\u3011).\n\nAtlas\u00a0Izacard et\u00a0al. (\u301020\u20202022\u3011) uses a custom pre-trained retrieval-augmented language model capable of learning knowledge-intensive tasks. It is a state-of-the-art model on the KILT benchmark\u00a0Petroni et\u00a0al. (\u301021\u20202021\u3011), which consists of 11 knowledge-oriented tasks including Wizard of Wikipedia. In this paper, we compare our system with this very strong baseline.\n\n###  2.3 Evaluating Factuality\n\nSeveral benchmarks have been released in recent years to train and test systems that can evaluate the factuality of individual claims. FEVER\u00a0Thorne et\u00a0al. (\u301022\u20202018\u3011) is a popular crowdsourced one that compares claims against evidence retrieved from Wikipedia. The state-of-the-art system on this dataset\u00a0Krishna et\u00a0al. (\u301023\u20202022\u3011) has a label accuracy of 81% when compared against human labels.\n\nDialFact\u00a0Gupta et\u00a0al. (\u301024\u20202022\u3011) builds on FEVER by introducing validation and test sets for evaluating factuality in dialogues. Both of these are static benchmarks, meaning that they are used to test systems on the fixed set of claims that are included in these benchmarks. However, it is possible to train classifiers on these datasets that can then be used to evaluate new claims\u00a0Dziri et\u00a0al. (\u301025\u20202022\u3011). \u00a0Honovich et\u00a0al. (\u301026\u20202021\u3011) uses question answering and natural language inference models to evaluate the factuality of dialogue agents. These two are examples of automatic metrics for factuality.\n\nDziri et\u00a0al. (\u301025\u20202022\u3011) compare several automatic metrics to human evaluation. They find that all automatic metrics they tested fell significantly behind human performance, and mostly relied on spurious correlations like word overlap with the evidence. Our evaluation methodology (Section \u301027\u20204\u3011) therefore incorporates human evaluation when needed.\n\n##  3 WikiChat, the Few-Shot Knowledge-Grounded Chatbot\n\nWe design WikiChat (Figure 1) to ground LLMs using Wikipedia to achieve the following objectives. While LLMs tend to hallucinate, our chatbot should be factual. While introducing facts to the conversation, we need to maintain the qualities of LLMs in being relevant, conversational, and engaging.\n\nGiven the history of a conversation between a user (U) and the agent (A) , WikiChat generates its utterance in two stages: 1) curates information that is correct and relevant to the context of the conversation, and 2) uses the gathered information to form the response .\n\nAt a high level, this is a generalization of the common retrieve-then-generate framework used in prior work. In each subsequent section, we describe each of the two stages of WikiChat, and highlight the novelties. Each part of WikiChat is implemented using carefully designed few-shot prompts with an LLM. As we explain in Section\u00a0\u301028\u20205\u3011, we initially experimented with using smaller fine-tuned models for some parts, but saw worse results due to the lack of flexibility and lower quality of those models. Please see Appendix \u301029\u2020D\u3011 for the few-shot prompts.\n\n###  3.1 Curating Information\n\nA common approach to ensure factuality is to first query the knowledge corpus according to the user\u2019s utterance, retrieve data to use in generating a response\u00a0Izacard et\u00a0al. (\u301020\u20202022\u3011); Chen et\u00a0al. (\u301014\u20202021\u3011); Shuster et\u00a0al. (\u301018\u20202022b\u3011). Such an approach does not leverage LLM\u2019s ability to interpret the question and to formulate responses that are out of reach of retrieval, or require aggregating information from many sources.\n\nConsider this example where an LLM is able to aggregate many pieces of information from what it has memorized during pre-training:\n\n>  \n> \n> User: \u201cI am very interested in William Faulkner and Toni Morrison. Can you suggest two books that they wrote that have a common theme? And discuss how these books are different stylistically?\u201d\n\n>  \n> \n> GPT-3.5: \u201cTwo books that have a common theme are \u2018The Sound and the Fury\u2019 and \u2018Beloved;\u2019. Both books are about families struggling with the aftermath of slavery. \u2018The Sound and the Fury\u2019 is told from the perspective of the white family, while \u2018Beloved\u2019 is told from the perspective of the black family. Both books are different stylistically in that \u2018The Sound and the Fury\u2019 is more experimental, while \u2018Beloved\u2019 is more straightforward.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, in general, LLMs cannot be trusted to be factual, thus we need to fact-check their outputs. LLMs may not be able to generate the right response, especially on events that happened after they were trained, or on topics in the long tail. Thus, to get the best of both worlds, we use both LLM generation and information retrieval. The output of this stage is a list of relevant bullet points, which can potentially be empty for turns that are pure chitchat (e.g. greeting).\n\n####  3.1.1 Retrieval from Corpus\n\nDuring a conversation with a user, WikiChat identifies when accessing external information is needed. This could be because the last user utterance contains a direct question (e.g. \u201cWho is Stephen Curry?\u201d) or otherwise requires additional information for a comprehensive response (e.g. \u201cI really like Stephen Curry.\u201d). WikiChat then generates a search query that captures the user\u2019s inquiry.\n\nWe discovered that temporal context plays a significant role in the user\u2019s information needs, while existing systems especially struggle with this. WikiChat generates the inferred time of the user\u2019s need alongside the query. The query time can be one of recent, year=yyyy, or none for when the retrieved information should be as recent as possible (\u201cDid you watch the latest Avatar movie?\u201d), for a specific year (\u201cI think the 2018 Super Bowl was the peak of his career.\u201d), or the time is not important (\u201cThe Beatles are my favorite band.\u201d) respectively. This is done in the query generation prompt (Table \u301030\u202010\u3011).\n\nWe send the query to an information retrieval (IR) system to obtain relevant passages from the corpus, and re-rank the top results based on the temporal information to get passages in the end.\n\nSince these paragraphs may contain a mixture of relevant and irrelevant sections, we use a prompt to extract relevant sections of the retrieved passages and summarize them into bullet points while filtering out the irrelevant parts (Table \u301031\u202011\u3011).\n\n####  3.1.2 LLM Generation and Fact-Checking\n\nWe prompt the LLM to generate a response to the history of the conversation. The response often contains interesting and relevant knowledge, but is inherently unreliable. We check their correctness against the knowledge corpus. This process is similar to how crowdsourced fact-checking datasets like FEVER\u00a0Thorne et\u00a0al. (\u301022\u20202018\u3011) and DialFact\u00a0Gupta et\u00a0al. (\u301024\u20202022\u3011) are constructed, but done automatically. This has the following steps:\n\n1. Breaking down claims. We use a prompt to break down the LLM response to multiple objective factual claims (Table \u301032\u202013\u3011). When breaking down knowledge from the LLM, we resolve co-references to reduce ambiguity, and resolve ambiguous time information like \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201clast year\u201d, to make all claims self-contained.\n\n2. Evidence Retrieval. We use an IR system to retrieve passages from the knowledge corpus to serve as evidence for each claim. We use the same time-based re-ranking as in Section \u301033\u20203.1.1\u3011 to better handle time-sensitive topics.\n\n3. Verification. The verification prompt (Table \u301034\u202014\u3011) assigns each claim to one of three classes: whether the retrieved evidence supports the claim, refutes the claim, or if there is not enough information in the evidence to make this decision. Only claims that are supported by the evidence are kept.\n\n###  3.2 Forming the Response\n\nOur next step is to turn relevant retrieved paragraphs and verified claims to generate an appealing response. Our experiments show that writing the final response in one go, while satisfying all the criteria for conversationality is challenging for LLMs. Moreover, the limited context length makes it difficult to provide enough few-shot examples to cover all these aspects at once, especially that each few-shot example needs to be a multi-turn conversation. Thus, we use a two-step approach.\n\n1. Generate a Draft Response. We prompt the LLM to given the list of bullet points and the history of the conversation, generate a response (Table \u301035\u202015\u3011).\n\n2. Generate Feedback and Refine the Response. We utilize a feedback and refine prompt that evaluates the response based on: relevance, naturalness, non-repetitiveness, and temporal correctness (Table \u301036\u202016\u3011). Relevance refers to the response being on-topic and directly addressing the user\u2019s query, acknowledging any off-topic information or partial answers. Naturalness assesses whether the response uses engaging and appropriate language to foster an interactive experience. Non-repetitiveness ensures the response avoids repeating previously mentioned information or statements. Temporal correctness requires the response to provide up-to-date information, use the correct tense, and respond specifically about the time mentioned by the user, if appropriate.\n\nThe LLM is prompted to provide its reasoning on each criterion, then assign a score in the range of 0 - 100 to each one. In the same prompt, the LLM is prompted to refine the response, drawing on the feedback and the scores as chain-of-thought. The idea of prompting LLMs to refine their own generations has been explored concurrent to this work in different contexts such as Self-Refine\u00a0Madaan et\u00a0al. (\u301037\u20202023\u3011).\n\n##  4 A Novel Evaluation Methodology\n\nWe argue that existing methods of evaluating conversational agents are no longer appropriate with the rapid advances of LLMs. At the same time, LLMs have made new ways of evaluation possible which are yet to be explored. We describe one effective way of doing so in this section.\n\nExisting conversational benchmarks like Wizard of Wikipedia\u00a0Dinan et\u00a0al. (\u30107\u20202019\u3011), DialFact\u00a0Gupta et\u00a0al. (\u301024\u20202022\u3011) or Wizard of Internet\u00a0Komeili et\u00a0al. (\u30108\u20202022\u3011) are crowdsourced and static.\n\nFirst, crowdsourcing limits the kind of conversations to familiar topics, and fail to model the diverse interests of real users. In this process, two crowdworkers are paired with each other, presented with a few conversation topics or personas to choose from and converse with the other worker. These topics need to be general familiar topics where the average crowdworker could be expected to be somewhat knowledgeable and interested about. As Komeili et\u00a0al. (\u30108\u20202022\u3011) put it, \u201cThe intent here is that they can choose a topic they are both more interested in themselves to talk about and also have enough knowledge of so that they can conduct a reasonable conversation.\u201d Since recent LLMs are already good conversants about familiar topics, testing LLMs on these topics would lead to the false conclusion that no innovation is necessary.\n\nSecond, static benchmarks are problematic because they quickly cease to measure the actual ability of chatbots to converse about up-to-date information whenever a new LLM with a newer cut-off date of its pre-training data is released. This is because, even putting data contamination Magar and Schwartz (\u301038\u20202022\u3011) aside, the data needed to respond to a static conversation from the benchmark is already seen during pre-training. For example, the Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark does not contain any topics that are not in GPT-3. It is simply not feasible to keep collecting new static benchmarks whenever the old ones become outdated in this sense.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, we propose to evaluate open-domain conversations by dynamically simulating user conversations on a set of carefully chosen topics, then evaluate the resulting conversations. We propose to use mix of human and computer techniques. Specifically, we use humans to evaluate the factuality and LLMs to evaluate the conversationality. Our method can evaluate chatbots that are trained on any data (e.g. Atlas), or not trained at all (e.g. GPT-3), systems that use information retrieval or not, without the need for access to gold knowledge evidence. It can also be easily extended in the future to evaluate more criteria, or to more conversation styles.\n\n###  4.1 User Simulation\n\nWe propose to evaluate chatbots with simulated users using LLMs. LLMs are good at simulating users: they have the general familiarity with world knowledge and know how users behave socially. They are free to occasionally hallucinate, make mistakes, and repeat or even contradict themselves, as human users sometimes do. They can easily be prompted to talk about any supplied topic, take on different personalities, and carry out any length of conversations. And they are fast and cost-effective.\n\nIn our experiment, we pick an article from the knowledge corpus Wikipedia (e.g. \u201cThe Last of Us TV Show\u201d) as a starter topic. This ensures that conversations can be later evaluated against the knowledge corpus. We provide the title and the first paragraph as context of the discussion to the simulated user. The simulated user is free to explore related topics from its own general knowledge, e.g. ask about other works of one of the actors. Note that the chatbot\u2019s response is not limited to what is in the article. See Table \u301039\u20209\u3011 for the full prompt.\n\n###  4.2 Conversation Topics\n\nFor the starting point of the simulator, we collected three types of topics: \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nHead topics: the type of topics that are present in previous benchmarks, information for which is likely to be present in the LLM pre-training data at high frequency. Examples include Albert Einstein or FC Barcelona.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nTail topics: Lesser known topics, information for which is likely to be present in the pre-training data of LLMs at low frequency. Examples include Thomas Percy Hilditch or Hell\u2019s Kitchen Suomi.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nRecent topics: topics that happened in 2023, and therefore are absent from the pre-training corpus of LLMs, even though some background information about them could be present. Examples include Spare (memoir) or 2023 Australian Open.\n\nSimilar to Mallen et\u00a0al. (\u301040\u20202022\u3011), we use the total number of views of a Wikipedia article as a proxy for how frequently each topic is likely to be discussed on the Web. Views in Wikipedia are to a large degree generated from other online sources. For example, when a ton of online news articles mention a topic, the article for that topic gets very high views. Direct analysis of the pre-training data of different language models is infeasible. For some, the data is not publicly available, and for others, given their very large size, only approximate and extremely noisy ways of topic identification are possible. \n\nFor recent topics, we look at the most edited Wikipedia articles\u00a0^{1}^{1}1 Filtering based on creation date did not lead to meaningful articles as there are many articles about old topics that just received articles in Wikipedia. Instead, in our experience, most of the highly edited Wikipedia articles are about actual new topics. in the first four months of 2023. The number of edits is also a good proxy for how much interest there is around a certain topic.\n\nWe obtain this information using the Wikimedia API\u00a0^{2}^{2}2 Accessed via \u301041\u2020https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/\u2020wikimedia.org\u3011 and manually remove topics that might be uncomfortable to talk about for some people (due to violence or explicit content) and ensure a diverse set of domains. We end up with 60 total conversation topics, 20 per topic type.\n\n###  4.3 Human Evaluation of Factual Accuracy\n\nAs discussed in Section\u00a0\u301042\u20203.1.2\u3011, WikiChat extracts and checks each claim in the LLM-generated response against retrieved evidence from the corpus.\n\nOur core verification problem is whether a claim is backed up by the retrieved paragraphs. We found that there is a significant gap between LLMs (even GPT-4) and human performance in this step. Therefore, we conduct human evaluation via crowdsourcing, to classify each claim as supported, refuted, or there is not enough information in the paragraphs. See Appendix \u301043\u2020C\u3011 for more details about human evaluation and our quality controls.\n\nThere are three reasons why a claim is classified as not having enough information: (1) The claim may be ill-formed such as missing a part of the context (e.g. \u201cHe was born in London.\u201d), or is not factual (e.g. \u201cI really like Steph Curry.\u201d). (2) IR has not retrieved the right paragraphs. (3) There is no information in Wikipedia. For example, we cannot support or refute a claim like \u201cPriyank Kharge is an avid reader\u201d because Wikipedia does not mention his hobbies anywhere. Our solution is to examine all claims that crowd workers classify as \u201cnot enough information\u201d by manually searching through all of Wikipedia to try to determine if the claims are supported or refuted, if possible.\n\nIn two separate preliminary studies, we found that using few-shot GPT-4 to extract claims generates well-formed claims 94% of the time, and that retrieving just 5 paragraphs already leads to 95% of claims being classified as either supported or refuted by crowdworkers. This is why the manual evaluation of \u201cnot enough information\u201d cases by the authors is feasible.\n\nWe define factual accuracy (FA) of a dialogue set as the percentage of claims that are supported by Wikipedia. The factual accuracy of a chatbot is the factual accuracy of the dialogues we obtain when pairing it with our user simulator on the 60 topics in our benchmark.\n\n###  4.4 Automatic Evaluation of Conversationality\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in addition to being factual, a chatbot\u2019s response should be conversational, which we measure by these 5 criteria:\n\n  1.  1.\n\nRelevant: whether the response is on-topic and directly addresses the user\u2019s question.\n\n  2.  2.\n\nInformational: The response provides a decent amount of information (factually accurate or not) when requested.\n\n  3.  3.\n\nNatural: The response uses appropriate and engaging language to create an interactive and enjoyable experience.\n\n  4.  4.\n\nNon-Repetitive: The response does not repeat previously mentioned information and does not ramble.\n\n  5.  5.\n\nTemporally Correct: The response should provide up-to-date information and use the appropriate tense.\n\nEven though using LLMs to assess factuality is not possible yet, LLMs can be effectively employed to evaluate soft qualities. For instance, Chiang and yi\u00a0Lee (\u301044\u20202023\u3011); He et\u00a0al. (\u301045\u20202023\u3011); Kocmi and Federmann (\u301046\u20202023\u3011); Liu et\u00a0al. (\u301047\u20202023\u3011) investigated LLM evaluation for tasks like story generation, machine translation and summarization, by presenting the models with the same instructions shown to human annotators. The results\nVisible: 0% - 28%", "summary": "[2305.14292] WikiChat: A Few-Shot LLM-Based Chatbot Grounded with Wikipedia (ar5iv.org)\n", "assets": []}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "[2305.14292] WikiChat: A Few-Shot LLM-Based Chatbot Grounded with Wikipedia", "url": "https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2305.14292.pdf", "text": "\nURL: https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2305.14292.pdf\n# WikiChat: A Few-Shot LLM-Based Chatbot   \nGrounded with Wikipedia\n\nSina J.

Lam   \nComputer Science Department   \nStanford University   \nStanford, CA   \n{sinaj, vyao, chenyuz, lam}@cs.stanford.edu\n\n###### Abstract\n\nDespite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), users still cannot trust the information provided in their responses. LLMs cannot speak accurately about events that occurred after their training, which are often topics of great interest to users, and, as we show in this paper, they are highly prone to hallucination when talking about less popular (tail) topics.\n\nThis paper presents WikiChat, a few-shot LLM-based chatbot that is grounded with live information from Wikipedia. Through many iterations of experimentation, we have crafted a pipeline based on information retrieval that (1) uses LLMs to suggest interesting and relevant facts that are individually verified against Wikipedia, (2) retrieves additional up-to-date information, and (3) composes coherent and engaging time-aware responses.\n\nWe propose a novel hybrid human-and-LLM evaluation methodology to analyze the factuality and conversationality of LLM-based chatbots. We focus on evaluating important but previously neglected issues such as conversing about recent and tail topics.\n\nWe evaluate WikiChat against strong fine-tuned and LLM-based baselines across a diverse set of conversation topics. We find that WikiChat outperforms all baselines in terms of the factual accuracy of its claims, by up to 12.1%, 28.3% and 32.7% on head, recent and tail topics, while matching GPT-3.5 in terms of providing natural, relevant, non-repetitive and informational responses.\n\n**footnotetext: Equal contribution  \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: All WikiChat components, and a sample conversation, edited for brevity. The steps taken to generate a response include 1) retrieval from Wikipedia, 2) summarizing and filtering the retrieved passages, 3) generating a response from an LLM, 4) extracting factual claims from the LLM response 5) fact-checking the claims in the LLM response, 6) drafting a response, and 7) refining the response.\n\nLarge language models have garnered a lot of interest from consumers because of their command of language as well as their broad skill set and knowledge. While they are very helpful as a task tool (e.g. writing an email or generating ideas) where the users have ultimate control over the final result, they are lacking as chatbots that end-users converse with to explore and learn more about what they find interesting, or to satisfy an information need. In this paper we argue that there are two major problems when using LLMs in this setting: that they cannot speak accurately about events that occurred after their pre-training (which are often the topics of interest), and are far less knowledgeable about less popular topics. Yet, they are prone to generating confident but misleading information (or hallucination). If a user of today\u2019s numerous chatbots wants to learn more about their favorite local music band or the latest book their favorite author wrote, they need to carefully and painstakingly verify any information they receive with external sources lest they be misled.\n\nIn this paper, we tackle knowledge-grounded conversations, where the main goal is to provide only trusted knowledge to users. We assume access to a source of trusted knowledge in the form of a text corpus, for instance the English Wikipedia. We refer to this desirable property of chatbots as factuality. As we show in our evaluation, some chatbots achieve this by presenting factual but unrelated and repetitive information, which is not helpful for users. Therefore, we emphasize that conversationality is also important.\n\nInformation retrieval (IR) has been shown to be an effective addition to language models on several knowledge-intensive tasks\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (2020); Shuster et\u00a0al. (2021a). However, existing methods either do not evaluate on conversations at all\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (2020); Trivedi et\u00a0al. (2022) and entirely ignore the conversationality part, or limit themselves to fact-checking LLM outputs\u00a0Gao et\u00a0al. (2022); Jiang et\u00a0al. (2023). Only fact-checking LLM outputs means that by design, they cannot access knowledge about recent events, since the starting point is the LLM which has no knowledge of recent events. Moreover, some require changes to the pre-training process\u00a0Lewis et\u00a0al. (2020); Guu et\u00a0al. (2020) of language models, which incur a heavy computational cost.\n\nWe posit that current LLMs, with their general-purpose pre-training and instruction-tuning\u00a0Ouyang et\u00a0al. (2022), have reached a level of quality that a carefully designed set of few-shot subtasks, that incorporate information retrieval at the right places, can address these issues. As such, we propose the first fully few-shot chatbot that provides up-to-date and fact-checked information in engaging conversations. \n\nOn the evaluation side, most chatbots are evaluated only on static crowdsourced benchmarks like Wizard of Wikipedia\u00a0Dinan et\u00a0al. (2019) and Wizard of Internet\u00a0Komeili et\u00a0al. (2022). Even when human evaluation is used, evaluation is conducted only on familiar discussion topics. This leads to an overestimation of the capabilities of chatbots. We propose a methodology to effectively test knowledge-based chatbots on a set of carefully chosen conversation topics with the help of user simulation, and human and automatic evaluation.\n\nOur contributions are:\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWikiChat, a few-shot chatbot that takes the best abilities of LLMs (which are highly conversational and good at piecing together information from the stored knowledge in their weights) and significantly improves its trustworthiness with the use of information retrieval. Designed to chat about any and all topics in Wikipedia, WikiChat has a carefully crafted 7-stage pipeline of few-shot prompted LLM as shown in Figure\u00a01.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nAn improved simulation-based benchmark design with a hybrid human-and-LLM evaluation technique. This helps circumvent the limitations of existing benchmarks, and for instance enables us to easily evaluate chatbots on any topic, including tail and recent topics, instead of having to stick with the ones that human annotators are familiar with.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWe show that WikiChat significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of factuality (24.4% better than GPT-3.5 on average) and conversationality (21.9% better than Atlas on average). We quantify the large gap in conversationality between models that use and do not use LLMs, and show how much LLMs struggle on tail and recent topics.\n\n##  2 Related Work\n\n###  2.1 Factuality of Large Language Models\n\nTo address the hallucination issues of LLMs, retrieval augmented generation methods Li et\u00a0al. (2022) have been used to improve the factuality of LLMs by integrating retrieved knowledge. Moreover, researchers have utilized fact-checking methods to verify and correct LLM outputs. Gao et\u00a0al. (2022) use query generation and evidence retrieval to attribute LLM outputs, and apply chain-of-thought prompting Wei et\u00a0al. (2022) to post-edit LLM outputs, ensuring consistency with external evidence. While useful for certain tasks, this strict definition of fact-checking (meaning that it needs to correct and output everything the base LLM generates) is not a good fit for knowledge-grounded conversations. In our design, we allow our chatbot to choose what to say; for example, if our fact-checking system is unsure about a certain claim, the chatbot can simply not say it.\n\nConcurrent with our work, Zhao et\u00a0al. (2023) refine reasoning chains using external knowledge, thereby enhancing the factuality of chain-of-thought prompting in knowledge-intensive tasks. Peng et\u00a0al. (2023) augment LLMs by grounding responses in task-specific databases and iteratively refining prompts using utility functions, including factuality scores.\n\n###  2.2 Knowledge-Grounded Chatbots\n\nIn the chatbot space, neural-retrieval-in-the-loop architectures have been used to develop knowledge-grounded chatbots with the goal of reducing hallucination \u00a0Shuster et\u00a0al. (2021b). BlenderBot 2 Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) builds upon BlenderBot 1 Roller et\u00a0al. (2020) by allowing the bot to incorporate information retrieved from the Internet for Wizard of the Internet Komeili et\u00a0al. (2021). SeeKeR Shuster et\u00a0al. (2022a) outperforms BlenderBot 2 Chen et\u00a0al. (2021) in open-domain knowledge-grounded conversations by utilizing a single language model for three modular tasks: generating search queries based on the input context, producing relevant knowledge responses using retrieved documents, and combining them with the input context to generate the final response.\n\nBlenderBot 3 Shuster et\u00a0al. (2022b) further improves the model by fine-tuning a 175B-parameter OPT\u00a0Zhang et\u00a0al. (2022) on several dialogue datasets, including several question answering and dialogue datasets like Wizard of Wikipedia\u00a0Dinan et\u00a0al. (2019) and Wizard of Internet\u00a0Komeili et\u00a0al. (2022).\n\nAtlas\u00a0Izacard et\u00a0al. (2022) uses a custom pre-trained retrieval-augmented language model capable of learning knowledge-intensive tasks. It is a state-of-the-art model on the KILT benchmark\u00a0Petroni et\u00a0al. (2021), which consists of 11 knowledge-oriented tasks including Wizard of Wikipedia. In this paper, we compare our system with this very strong baseline.\n\n###  2.3 Evaluating Factuality\n\nSeveral benchmarks have been released in recent years to train and test systems that can evaluate the factuality of individual claims. FEVER\u00a0Thorne et\u00a0al. (2018) is a popular crowdsourced one that compares claims against evidence retrieved from Wikipedia. The state-of-the-art system on this dataset\u00a0Krishna et\u00a0al. (2022) has a label accuracy of 81% when compared against human labels.\n\nDialFact\u00a0Gupta et\u00a0al. (2022) builds on FEVER by introducing validation and test sets for evaluating factuality in dialogues. Both of these are static benchmarks, meaning that they are used to test systems on the fixed set of claims that are included in these benchmarks. However, it is possible to train classifiers on these datasets that can then be used to evaluate new claims\u00a0Dziri et\u00a0al. (2022). \u00a0Honovich et\u00a0al. (2021) uses question answering and natural language inference models to evaluate the factuality of dialogue agents. These two are examples of automatic metrics for factuality.\n\nDziri et\u00a0al. (2022) compare several automatic metrics to human evaluation. They find that all automatic metrics they tested fell significantly behind human performance, and mostly relied on spurious correlations like word overlap with the evidence. Our evaluation methodology (Section 4) therefore incorporates human evaluation when needed.\n\n##  3 WikiChat, the Few-Shot Knowledge-Grounded Chatbot\n\nWe design WikiChat (Figure 1) to ground LLMs using Wikipedia to achieve the following objectives. While LLMs tend to hallucinate, our chatbot should be factual. While introducing facts to the conversation, we need to maintain the qualities of LLMs in being relevant, conversational, and engaging.\n\nGiven the history of a conversation between a user (U) and the agent (A) , WikiChat generates its utterance in two stages: 1) curates information that is correct and relevant to the context of the conversation, and 2) uses the gathered information to form the response .\n\nAt a high level, this is a generalization of the common retrieve-then-generate framework used in prior work. In each subsequent section, we describe each of the two stages of WikiChat, and highlight the novelties. Each part of WikiChat is implemented using carefully designed few-shot prompts with an LLM. As we explain in Section\u00a05, we initially experimented with using smaller fine-tuned models for some parts, but saw worse results due to the lack of flexibility and lower quality of those models. Please see Appendix D for the few-shot prompts.\n\n###  3.1 Curating Information\n\nA common approach to ensure factuality is to first query the knowledge corpus according to the user\u2019s utterance, retrieve data to use in generating a response\u00a0Izacard et\u00a0al. (2022); Chen et\u00a0al. (2021); Shuster et\u00a0al. (2022b). Such an approach does not leverage LLM\u2019s ability to interpret the question and to formulate responses that are out of reach of retrieval, or require aggregating information from many sources.\n\nConsider this example where an LLM is able to aggregate many pieces of information from what it has memorized during pre-training:\n\n>  \n> \n> User: \u201cI am very interested in William Faulkner and Toni Morrison. Can you suggest two books that they wrote that have a common theme? And discuss how these books are different stylistically?\u201d\n\n>  \n> \n> GPT-3.5: \u201cTwo books that have a common theme are \u2018The Sound and the Fury\u2019 and \u2018Beloved;\u2019. Both books are about families struggling with the aftermath of slavery. \u2018The Sound and the Fury\u2019 is told from the perspective of the white family, while \u2018Beloved\u2019 is told from the perspective of the black family. Both books are different stylistically in that \u2018The Sound and the Fury\u2019 is more experimental, while \u2018Beloved\u2019 is more straightforward.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, in general, LLMs cannot be trusted to be factual, thus we need to fact-check their outputs. LLMs may not be able to generate the right response, especially on events that happened after they were trained, or on topics in the long tail. Thus, to get the best of both worlds, we use both LLM generation and information retrieval. The output of this stage is a list of relevant bullet points, which can potentially be empty for turns that are pure chitchat (e.g. greeting).\n\n####  3.1.1 Retrieval from Corpus\n\nDuring a conversation with a user, WikiChat identifies when accessing external information is needed. This could be because the last user utterance contains a direct question (e.g. \u201cWho is Stephen Curry?\u201d) or otherwise requires additional information for a comprehensive response (e.g. \u201cI really like Stephen Curry.\u201d). WikiChat then generates a search query that captures the user\u2019s inquiry.\n\nWe discovered that temporal context plays a significant role in the user\u2019s information needs, while existing systems especially struggle with this. WikiChat generates the inferred time of the user\u2019s need alongside the query. The query time can be one of recent, year=yyyy, or none for when the retrieved information should be as recent as possible (\u201cDid you watch the latest Avatar movie?\u201d), for a specific year (\u201cI think the 2018 Super Bowl was the peak of his career.\u201d), or the time is not important (\u201cThe Beatles are my favorite band.\u201d) respectively. This is done in the query generation prompt (Table 10).\n\nWe send the query to an information retrieval (IR) system to obtain relevant passages from the corpus, and re-rank the top results based on the temporal information to get passages in the end.\n\nSince these paragraphs may contain a mixture of relevant and irrelevant sections, we use a prompt to extract relevant sections of the retrieved passages and summarize them into bullet points while filtering out the irrelevant parts (Table 11).\n\n####  3.1.2 LLM Generation and Fact-Checking\n\nWe prompt the LLM to generate a response to the history of the conversation. The response often contains interesting and relevant knowledge, but is inherently unreliable. We check their correctness against the knowledge corpus. This process is similar to how crowdsourced fact-checking datasets like FEVER\u00a0Thorne et\u00a0al. (2018) and DialFact\u00a0Gupta et\u00a0al. (2022) are constructed, but done automatically. This has the following steps:\n\n1. Breaking down claims. We use a prompt to break down the LLM response to multiple objective factual claims (Table 13). When breaking down knowledge from the LLM, we resolve co-references to reduce ambiguity, and resolve ambiguous time information like \u201ccurrent\u201d and \u201clast year\u201d, to make all claims self-contained.\n\n2. Evidence Retrieval. We use an IR system to retrieve passages from the knowledge corpus to serve as evidence for each claim. We use the same time-based re-ranking as in Section 3.1.1 to better handle time-sensitive topics.\n\n3. Verification. The verification prompt (Table 14) assigns each claim to one of three classes: whether the retrieved evidence supports the claim, refutes the claim, or if there is not enough information in the evidence to make this decision. Only claims that are supported by the evidence are kept.\n\n###  3.2 Forming the Response\n\nOur next step is to turn relevant retrieved paragraphs and verified claims to generate an appealing response. Our experiments show that writing the final response in one go, while satisfying all the criteria for conversationality is challenging for LLMs. Moreover, the limited context length makes it difficult to provide enough few-shot examples to cover all these aspects at once, especially that each few-shot example needs to be a multi-turn conversation. Thus, we use a two-step approach.\n\n1. Generate a Draft Response. We prompt the LLM to given the list of bullet points and the history of the conversation, generate a response (Table 15).\n\n2. Generate Feedback and Refine the Response. We utilize a feedback and refine prompt that evaluates the response based on: relevance, naturalness, non-repetitiveness, and temporal correctness (Table 16). Relevance refers to the response being on-topic and directly addressing the user\u2019s query, acknowledging any off-topic information or partial answers. Naturalness assesses whether the response uses engaging and appropriate language to foster an interactive experience. Non-repetitiveness ensures the response avoids repeating previously mentioned information or statements. Temporal correctness requires the response to provide up-to-date information, use the correct tense, and respond specifically about the time mentioned by the user, if appropriate.\n\nThe LLM is prompted to provide its reasoning on each criterion, then assign a score in the range of 0 - 100 to each one. In the same prompt, the LLM is prompted to refine the response, drawing on the feedback and the scores as chain-of-thought. The idea of prompting LLMs to refine their own generations has been explored concurrent to this work in different contexts such as Self-Refine\u00a0Madaan et\u00a0al. (2023).\n\n##  4 A Novel Evaluation Methodology\n\nWe argue that existing methods of evaluating conversational agents are no longer appropriate with the rapid advances of LLMs. At the same time, LLMs have made new ways of evaluation possible which are yet to be explored. We describe one effective way of doing so in this section.\n\nExisting conversational benchmarks like Wizard of Wikipedia\u00a0Dinan et\u00a0al. (2019), DialFact\u00a0Gupta et\u00a0al. (2022) or Wizard of Internet\u00a0Komeili et\u00a0al. (2022) are crowdsourced and static.\n\nFirst, crowdsourcing limits the kind of conversations to familiar topics, and fail to model the diverse interests of real users. In this process, two crowdworkers are paired with each other, presented with a few conversation topics or personas to choose from and converse with the other worker. These topics need to be general familiar topics where the average crowdworker could be expected to be somewhat knowledgeable and interested about. As Komeili et\u00a0al. (2022) put it, \u201cThe intent here is that they can choose a topic they are both more interested in themselves to talk about and also have enough knowledge of so that they can conduct a reasonable conversation.\u201d Since recent LLMs are already good conversants about familiar topics, testing LLMs on these topics would lead to the false conclusion that no innovation is necessary.\n\nSecond, static benchmarks are problematic because they quickly cease to measure the actual ability of chatbots to converse about up-to-date information whenever a new LLM with a newer cut-off date of its pre-training data is released. This is because, even putting data contamination Magar and Schwartz (2022) aside, the data needed to respond to a static conversation from the benchmark is already seen during pre-training. For example, the Wizard of Wikipedia benchmark does not contain any topics that are not in GPT-3. It is simply not feasible to keep collecting new static benchmarks whenever the old ones become outdated in this sense.\n\nTo address these shortcomings, we propose to evaluate open-domain conversations by dynamically simulating user conversations on a set of carefully chosen topics, then evaluate the resulting conversations. We propose to use mix of human and computer techniques. Specifically, we use humans to evaluate the factuality and LLMs to evaluate the conversationality. Our method can evaluate chatbots that are trained on any data (e.g. Atlas), or not trained at all (e.g. GPT-3), systems that use information retrieval or not, without the need for access to gold knowledge evidence. It can also be easily extended in the future to evaluate more criteria, or to more conversation styles.\n\n###  4.1 User Simulation\n\nWe propose to evaluate chatbots with simulated users using LLMs. LLMs are good at simulating users: they have the general familiarity with world knowledge and know how users behave socially. They are free to occasionally hallucinate, make mistakes, and repeat or even contradict themselves, as human users sometimes do. They can easily be prompted to talk about any supplied topic, take on different personalities, and carry out any length of conversations. And they are fast and cost-effective.\n\nIn our experiment, we pick an article from the knowledge corpus Wikipedia (e.g. \u201cThe Last of Us TV Show\u201d) as a starter topic. This ensures that conversations can be later evaluated against the knowledge corpus. We provide the title and the first paragraph as context of the discussion to the simulated user. The simulated user is free to explore related topics from its own general knowledge, e.g. ask about other works of one of the actors. Note that the chatbot\u2019s response is not limited to what is in the article. See Table 9 for the full prompt.\n\n###  4.2 Conversation Topics\n\nFor the starting point of the simulator, we collected three types of topics: \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nHead topics: the type of topics that are present in previous benchmarks, information for which is likely to be present in the LLM pre-training data at high frequency. Examples include Albert Einstein or FC Barcelona.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nTail topics: Lesser known topics, information for which is likely to be present in the pre-training data of LLMs at low frequency. Examples include Thomas Percy Hilditch or Hell\u2019s Kitchen Suomi.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nRecent topics: topics that happened in 2023, and therefore are absent from the pre-training corpus of LLMs, even though some background information about them could be present. Examples include Spare (memoir) or 2023 Australian Open.\n\nSimilar to Mallen et\u00a0al. (2022), we use the total number of views of a Wikipedia article as a proxy for how frequently each topic is likely to be discussed on the Web. Views in Wikipedia are to a large degree generated from other online sources. For example, when a ton of online news articles mention a topic, the article for that topic gets very high views. Direct analysis of the pre-training data of different language models is infeasible. For some, the data is not publicly available, and for others, given their very large size, only approximate and extremely noisy ways of topic identification are possible. \n\nFor recent topics, we look at the most edited Wikipedia articles\u00a0^{1}^{1}1 Filtering based on creation date did not lead to meaningful articles as there are many articles about old topics that just received articles in Wikipedia. Instead, in our experience, most of the highly edited Wikipedia articles are about actual new topics. in the first four months of 2023. The number of edits is also a good proxy for how much interest there is around a certain topic.\n\nWe obtain this information using the Wikimedia API\u00a0^{2}^{2}2 Accessed via https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/ and manually remove topics that might be uncomfortable to talk about for some people (due to violence or explicit content) and ensure a diverse set of domains. We end up with 60 total conversation topics, 20 per topic type.\n\n###  4.3 Human Evaluation of Factual Accuracy\n\nAs discussed in Section\u00a03.1.2, WikiChat extracts and checks each claim in the LLM-generated response against retrieved evidence from the corpus.\n\nOur core verification problem is whether a claim is backed up by the retrieved paragraphs. We found that there is a significant gap between LLMs (even GPT-4) and human performance in this step. Therefore, we conduct human evaluation via crowdsourcing, to classify each claim as supported, refuted, or there is not enough information in the paragraphs. See Appendix C for more details about human evaluation and our quality controls.\n\nThere are three reasons why a claim is classified as not having enough information: (1) The claim may be ill-formed such as missing a part of the context (e.g. \u201cHe was born in London.\u201d), or is not factual (e.g. \u201cI really like Steph Curry.\u201d). (2) IR has not retrieved the right paragraphs. (3) There is no information in Wikipedia. For example, we cannot support or refute a claim like \u201cPriyank Kharge is an avid reader\u201d because Wikipedia does not mention his hobbies anywhere. Our solution is to examine all claims that crowd workers classify as \u201cnot enough information\u201d by manually searching through all of Wikipedia to try to determine if the claims are supported or refuted, if possible.\n\nIn two separate preliminary studies, we found that using few-shot GPT-4 to extract claims generates well-formed claims 94% of the time, and that retrieving just 5 paragraphs already leads to 95% of claims being classified as either supported or refuted by crowdworkers. This is why the manual evaluation of \u201cnot enough information\u201d cases by the authors is feasible.\n\nWe define factual accuracy (FA) of a dialogue set as the percentage of claims that are supported by Wikipedia. The factual accuracy of a chatbot is the factual accuracy of the dialogues we obtain when pairing it with our user simulator on the 60 topics in our benchmark.\n\n###  4.4 Automatic Evaluation of Conversationality\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in addition to being factual, a chatbot\u2019s response should be conversational, which we measure by these 5 criteria:\n\n  1.  1.\n\nRelevant: whether the response is on-topic and directly addresses the user\u2019s question.\n\n  2.  2.\n\nInformational: The response provides a decent amount of information (factually accurate or not) when requested.\n\n  3.  3.\n\nNatural: The response uses appropriate and engaging language to create an interactive and enjoyable experience.\n\n  4.  4.\n\nNon-Repetitive: The response does not repeat previously mentioned information and does not ramble.\n\n  5.  5.\n\nTemporally Correct: The response should provide up-to-date information and use the appropriate tense.\n\nEven though using LLMs to assess factuality is not possible yet, LLMs can be effectively employed to evaluate soft qualities. For instance, Chiang and yi\u00a0Lee (2023); He et\u00a0al. (2023); Kocmi and Federmann (2023); Liu et\u00a0al. (2023) investigated LLM evaluation for tasks like story generation, machine translation and summarization, by presenting the models with the same instructions shown to human annotators.

Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.\n\n###  1 Introduction\n\nDespite similarities with other sequence modeling problems, such as text, audio, or video, time series has two particularly challenging properties. Unlike video or audio, which typically have consistent input scales and sampling rates, aggregated time series datasets often comprise sequences from radically different sources, sometimes with missing values. Moreover, common applications of time series forecasting, such as weather or financial data, require extrapolating from observations that contain a tiny fraction of the possible information, making accurate point predictions nearly impossible and uncertainty estimation especially important. While large-scale pretraining has become a key element of training large neural networks in vision and text, enabling performance to scale directly with data availability, pretraining is not typically used for time series modeling, where there is no consensus unsupervised objective and large, cohesive pretraining datasets are not readily available. Consequently, simple time series methods (e.g. ARIMA\u00a0(Box and Jenkins, \u30100\u20201968\u3011), and linear models\u00a0(Zeng et\u00a0al., \u30101\u20202022\u3011)) often outperform deep learning methods on popular benchmarks (Hewamalage et\u00a0al., \u30102\u20202023\u3011).\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate how large language models (LLM) can naturally bridge the gap between the simple biases of traditional methods and the complex representational learning and generative abilities of modern deep learning. In particular, we introduce an exceedingly simple method, LLMTime^{1}^{1}1\u30103\u2020https://github.com/ngruver/llmtime\u2020github.com\u3011, to apply pretrained LLMs for continuous time series prediction problems, illustrated at a high level in Figure 1. At its core, this method represents the time series as a string of numerical digits, and views time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text, unlocking the use of powerful pretrained models and probabilistic capacities, such as likelihood evaluation and sampling. To enable strong performance, we propose techniques to (1) effectively encode time series as a string of numerical digits and (2) adapt the discrete distributions of LLMs to continuous densities capable of modeling sophisticated multimodal distributions. Using these techniques, we find LLMTime can exceed or match purpose-built time series methods over a range of different problems in a zero-shot fashion, meaning that LLMTime can be used without any fine-tuning on the downstream data used by other models.\n\nThe zero-shot nature of LLMTime carries several natural advantages: (1) it facilitates the straightforward application of LLMs, eliminating the necessity for specialized knowledge of fine-tuning procedures and the substantial computational resources required for these procedures, as well as side-stepping access issues surrounding proprietary source code or APIs for LLM training or fine-tuning; (2) it is naturally suited to scenarios with limited data availability, where there is little information for training or fine-tuning; (3) by leveraging the broad pattern extrapolation capabilities of extensively pre-trained LLMs, it circumvents the extensive time, effort, and domain-specific expertise typically required for crafting dedicated time series models.\n\nTo understand the origins of LLMTime\u2019s impressive performance, we investigate how LLMs express preferences for simple or repetitive sequences (Goldblum et\u00a0al., \u30104\u20202023\u3011) and show that these biases are in fact compatible with the salient structure of time series, such as seasonality. Aside from these biases, LLMs also can naturally acccommodate missing data, and express multimodal distributions, which is particularly useful for time series. We also show how LLMs enable appealing functionality, such as the ability to provide additional side information through prompting, and query the LLM to explain its predictions.\n\nFinally, in addition to broadly compelling forecasting performance, we find performance tends to improve with scale, and the quality of point predictions also improves with the quality of the uncertainty representation. However, we also find GPT-4 has worse uncertainty calibration than GPT-3, likely due to interventions such as reinforcement learning by human feedback (RLHF).\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: We propose LLMTime, a method for time series forecasting with large language models (LLMs) by encoding numbers as text and sampling possible extrapolations as text completions. LLMTime can outperform many popular time series methods without any training on the target dataset (i.e. zero-shot). The performance of LLMTime also scales with the power of the underlying base model. Notably, models that undergo alignment (e.g. RLHF) do not follow the scaling trend. For example, GPT-4 demonstrates inferior performance to GPT-3 (Section \u30105\u20206\u3011).  \n\n###  2 Background\n\nLanguage modeling \u00a0\u00a0 Language models are trained on a collection of sequences, , where and each token, , belongs to a vocabulary . Large language models typically encode an autoregressive distribution, in which the probability of each token is only dependent on the previous tokens in the sequence, . The parameters, , are learned by maximizing the probability of the entire dataset . Every language model has an associated tokenizer, which breaks an input string into a sequence of tokens, each belonging to . Proper tokenization is extremely important, and small details can have surprisingly significant effects. The most common tokenization method for autoregressive language models is byte-pair encoding (BPE), which treats inputs like bit strings and assigns tokens based on the rate of occurrence in the training corpus, optimizing for shorter sequences of tokens on average. Sampling from a language model typically starts with a prompt, , and proceeds sequentially using , which is often preprocessed, for example through temperature scaling or nucleus sampling (Holtzman et\u00a0al., \u30106\u20202019\u3011).\n\nLarge language models \u00a0\u00a0 Brown et\u00a0al. (\u30107\u20202020\u3011) showed that increasing a language model\u2019s parameter count and training data size leads to new capabilities such as zero-shot generalization, in which a model can perform a text-formatted task without training the model parameters on any task-specific data. Large language models, for example GPT-3 (Brown et\u00a0al., \u30107\u20202020\u3011) or LLaMA-2 (Touvron et\u00a0al., \u30108\u20202023b\u3011), accomplish this form of generalization through in-context learning, which identifies patterns in the language model\u2019s prompt and extrapolates them through next-token prediction. Many authors have speculated that in-context learning emerges from a language model\u2019s extensive compression of the input data (Goldblum et\u00a0al., \u30104\u20202023\u3011; Sutskever, \u30109\u20202023\u3011; Del\u00e9tang et\u00a0al., \u301010\u20202023\u3011). Compression favors learning algorithms that operate over the input data with programmatic abstractions, for example, context-free grammars (Allen-Zhu and Li, \u301011\u20202023\u3011) or induction heads (Olsson et\u00a0al., \u301012\u20202022\u3011), which can implement copy-and-paste type operations for generating samples with highly structured syntax. In this work, we show that the zero-shot generalization abilities of LLMs and their preference for compressible patterns extend well beyond language understanding and can be used for time series forecasting.\n\nZero-shot generalization has made LLMs significantly more useful as assistants, leading to the create of methods to align LLMs with human preferences and instructions, for example reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et\u00a0al., \u301013\u20202022\u3011) and instruction tuning (Wei et\u00a0al., \u301014\u20202021\u3011). While key to modern LLMs products, alignment methods can also significantly affect the abilities and calibration of the underlying model (OpenAI, \u301015\u20202023\u3011; Bubeck et\u00a0al., \u301016\u20202023\u3011). Here we show these methods can also affect forecasting ability.\n\nTime series data \u00a0\u00a0 Time series data typically takes the exact same form as language modeling data, as a collection of sequences , but in time series is numerical. Because language models are built to represent complex probability distributions over sequences, they are theoretically well-suited for time series modeling. In practice, however, language models are held back by the details of tokenizing numbers. BPE compresses numbers based on frequency of occurrence in the training data, so numbers can be broken down into awkward chunks that make learning basic numerical operations challenging. Touvron et\u00a0al. (\u301017\u20202023a\u3011) therefore designed the LLaMA tokenizer to map numbers to individual digits, which can lead to significant improvements in mathematical abilities, with small LLaMA models outperforming GPT-4 (Liu and Low, \u301018\u20202023\u3011).\n\nThe other challenge of applying language models to time series data is proper evaluation. Mean absolute error (MAE) is commonly used but ignores uncertainty in the forecast which is highly limiting for stochastic data (Hewamalage et\u00a0al., \u30102\u20202023\u3011; Benton et\u00a0al., \u301019\u20202022\u3011). Continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) captures distributional qualities and can compare models that generate samples without likelihoods. For a single prediction, the CRPS score is defined against the estimated cumulative distribution function (CDF), as where is the empirical CDF produced by sampling forecasts and is the indicator function. While CRPS is an improvement over MAE, it also ignores key structures in the data, such as correlations between time steps. Fortunately, language models can assign likelihoods to full sequences of time series data, and we show how a small modification to an LLM\u2019s discrete likelihood can yield a continuous density that is useful for model comparison.\n\nLanguage models for time series \u00a0\u00a0 Several authors have explored using pretrained language model encoders as initializations for time series models. For example, Zhou et\u00a0al. (\u301020\u20202023\u3011) propose FPT, which finetunes a BERT encoder to perform time series forecasting. Similarly, Zhang et\u00a0al. (\u301021\u20202023\u3011) introduce Meta-Transformer, a framework for finetuning a language model for non-text modalities, including time series. Fewer papers explore using LLMs as forecasters without finetuning. The only method we are aware of is PromptCast\u00a0(Xue and Salim, \u301022\u20202023\u3011), which poses forecasting as question answering with prompting.\n\nOur work \u00a0\u00a0 Unlike methods that leverage LLM backbones, our method is entirely zero-shot and does not require finetuning. Unlike PromptCast, we show that LLMs can be used directly as forecasters without any added text or prompt engineering, if we carefully preprocess the numerical values themselves. Our method solely relies on LLM\u2019s abilities to extrapolate patterns in general sequences and nothing particular to English or any other language. Going beyond prior work, we also cultivate the probabilistic nature of large language models and their ability to capture uncertainty over highly stochastic time series.\n\n###  3 LLMTime: Forecasting with Language Models\n\nForecasting with LLMTime has relatively few steps. Once the numerical values are processed into strings, making predictions with the language model follows standard sampling procedures. As we show next, however, correct pre-processing is not always intuitive but is extremely important, and incorrect handling can lead to unusable predictions.\n\nTokenization \u00a0\u00a0 Tokenization is particularly important because it directly influences how patterns form within tokenized sequences and the types of operations that language models can learn. Unfortunately, common tokenization methods like BPE tend to break a single number into tokens that don\u2019t align with the digits, which can make arithmetic considerably more difficult (Liu and Low, \u301018\u20202023\u3011). For example, the number gets tokenized as by the GPT-3 tokenizer, and changes by even a single digit can result in an entirely different tokenization. By contrast, in many new open-source LLMs (e.g. LLaMA (Touvron et\u00a0al., \u301017\u20202023a\u3011)), numbers are tokenized into individual digits by default. To remedy the tokenization of GPT models, we separate the digits with spaces to force a separate tokenization of each digit and use a comma (\" ,\") to separate each time step in a time series. Because decimal points are redundant given a fixed precision, we drop them in the encoding to save on context length. Thus, with e.g. digits of precision, we pre-process a time series as follows before feeding into the tokenizer:\n\nIn Figure 2, we show that the added spaces of this encoding are helpful for GPT models, preventing the model from getting derailed by outputting an unusual token during sampling. For LLaMA models, with their unique tokenization of numbers, added spaces have the opposite effect. Each digit and space is already assigned its own token, and space tokens become nuisance inputs, adding to the sequence length without simplifying the sequence\u2019s structure and potentially making the sequence out-of-distribution to the model.\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: Careful tokenization is important for good forecasting with LLMs. Using the Australian Wine dataset from Darts (Herzen et\u00a0al., \u301023\u20202022\u3011), with values [151, 167, \u2026, 267], we show the tokenization used by GPT-3\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., \u30107\u20202020\u3011) and LLaMA-2\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., \u30108\u20202023b\u3011) and the corresponding effect on forecasting performance. Added spaces allow GPT-3 to create one token per digit, leading to good performance. LLaMA-2, on the other hand, tokenizes digits individually, and adding spaces hurts performance.\n\nRescaling \u00a0\u00a0 To avoid wasting tokens when the inputs are very large, we scale values down so that the -percentile of rescaled time series values is . We avoid scaling by the maximum value so that the LLM can see some fraction of examples () where the number of digits changes and reproduce this behavior in its outputs to produce larger values than it has seen. We also experiment with an offset based calculate as a percentile of the input data, and we tune these two parameters on validation log likelihoods (details in \u301024\u2020Appendix A\u3011).\n\nSampling / Forecasting \u00a0\u00a0 To forecast, draw many samples (e.g. 20) from the LLM and use the statistics of the samples at each time step to construct a point estimate (e.g. as the median) or probabilistic forecast (e.g. as quantiles). To control sampling, we use temperature scaling, logit bias, and nucleus sampling (Appendix \u301025\u2020C\u3011).\n\nContinuous likelihoods \u00a0\u00a0 Modeling sequences of individual digits has additional benefits beyond good samples. With digits of precision in base , each sequence of digits after the decimal place corresponds to one of possible bins (\u301026\u2020Figure 3\u3011), each with width . As each distribution is a softmax over possible digits, we can view the distribution over each individual number as a hierarchical softmax (Mnih and Hinton, \u301027\u20202008\u3011), with . Though a language model\u2019s probability distribution is discrete, we can easily adapt it to provide a continuous density by placing a uniform distribution in each bin. Enumerating each of the countably infinite numbers that the model can produce (because the model can output an arbitrary number of digits before the decimal point) with an index each with probability , we can write out the distribution as a mixture of disjoint uniform distributions over the bins where . Therefore if a given data point lies in bin , its continuous log likelihood is . Finally, to obtain the likelihood in the original input space, we add a change of variables factor where is the rescaling operation in the pre-processing. As a result, the exponentially large number of bins and exponentially small bin widths enabled by our construction make it surprisingly efficient to represent flexible and high-resolution continuous distributions with LLMs, despite using a discrete tokenization of numbers.\n\nLanguage models as flexible distributions \u00a0\u00a0 The fact that LLMs can express flexible distributions over numbers is key for time series data. Uncertainty quantification is essential to forecasting, and typical approaches to representing uncertainty in time series can be limited by misspecification. For example, one common method for creating a probabilistic forecast is to fit a Gaussian or Laplace observation model. When the underlying data distribution is multimodal, both of these models will perform poorly. Methods like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) solve the issue of multimodality but introduce additional challenges to optimization and model selection. We show that a language model is an underrated solution by training a small autoregressive model on a variety of one-dimensional distributions shown in \u301026\u2020Figure 3\u3011 (right). These distributions come from an exponential random variable, a mixture of a uniform and a student-t distribution, and the heavy-tailed distribution of time series prediction residuals from an ARIMA model on the MonthlyMilk dataset (Herzen et\u00a0al., \u301023\u20202022\u3011). We evaluate these fits quantitatively by computing Wasserstein distances, and compare to a Laplace observation model, a GMM trained with expectation-maximization, and logistic regression over a flat binning of the data (with a tuned bin size). Each model is trained with only samples from the distribution. The results show that the decimal autoregressive language model (\u201cDecimal AR\u201d) performs extremely well, handling asymmetric, multimodal, and heavy-tailed distributions, which are among the diverse types characteristic of time series data.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption]\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 3: (left): Autoregressive models over sequences of digits act like hierarchical softmax distributions over the corresponding numbers. When combined with uniform distributions in each discrete bucket, distributions over strings can become expressive distributions over continuous domains (right): Using simple autoregressive models (e.g. RNNs) trained on a string representation of numbers, we can fit complex distributions that can be challenging for other methods, such as heavy-tailed or multimodal distributions. A simple autoregressive model can match or outperform well-known methods for density estimation, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) or binning with a fixed resolution, as measured by Wasserstein distance between samples.  \n\n###  4 Experiments\n\nWe evaluate the zero-shot forecasting ability of LLMs by comparing LLMTime with GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 70B to many popular time series baselines on a variety of benchmark time series datasets. Not only is LLMTime able to generate plausible completions of the real and synthetic time series, it achieves higher likelihoods and CRPS values in zero-shot evaluation than the dedicated time series models like ARIMA, TCNs, and N-HiTS. When evaluated on deterministic metrics like MAE, LLMs also perform well, obtain the best or second best MAE values on each benchmark. As we are using LLMs with undisclosed datasets, data leakage is an important concern that we address directly in Appendix\u00a0\u301028\u2020B\u3011. Beyond strong performance on standard benchmarks, which are the most useful for comparison, we find that LLMTime also performs well on datasets that could not have been present in the base model\u2019s training data. The full set of hyperparameters used for LLMTime and the baseline methods are detailed in Appendix \u301029\u2020C.1\u3011. For some of the longer time series, not all of the history can be fit into the context window, and hence hyperparameters implicitly capture the trade-off between higher precision and capturing a larger temporal history.\n\nDatasets \u00a0\u00a0 We use three benchmark datasets that are common within deep learning research and many baseline methods that accompany the benchmark datasets.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nDarts (Herzen et\u00a0al., \u301023\u20202022\u3011): A collection of 8 real univariate time series datasets. For Darts, we use several methods that are implemented directly in the package, including neural network models (TCN\u00a0(Lea et\u00a0al., \u301030\u20202016\u3011), N-BEATS\u00a0(Oreshkin et\u00a0al., \u301031\u20202020\u3011), N-HiTS\u00a0(Challu et\u00a0al., \u301032\u20202022\u3011)) and simple moving average models (ARIMA (Box and Jenkins, \u30100\u20201968\u3011)). Darts enables learning observation models with tractable likelihoods and is therefore especially useful for benchmarking the probabilistic predictions of LLMTime. We also include Spectral Mixture Gaussian Process (SM-GP) (Wilson and Adams, \u301033\u20202013\u3011), a Bayesian nonparametric method (details in Appendix\u00a0\u301029\u2020C.1\u3011).\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nMonash\u00a0(Godahewa et\u00a0al., \u301034\u20202021\u3011): The Monash forecasting archive contains 30 publicly available datasets along with baseline numbers for 12 forecasting models, including simple exponential smooth (e.g. ETS (Hyndman et\u00a0al., \u301035\u20202008\u3011)), gradient boosting (e.g. CatBoost (Prokhorenkova et\u00a0al., \u301036\u20202018\u3011)) and deep learning models (e.g. DeepAR (Salinas et\u00a0al., \u301037\u20202020\u3011), WaveNet (Oord et\u00a0al., \u301038\u20202016\u3011)). The Monash archive comprises over 400,000 individual time series, making it infeasible to use in its entirety with the largest available LLMs. To reduce the computational burden, we evaluate GPT-3\u2019s zero-shot performance on the top 16 datasets where the baseline models perform the best (details in Appendix\u00a0\u301039\u2020C.2\u3011).\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nInformer\u00a0(Zhou et\u00a0al., \u301040\u20202021\u3011): We evaluated on multivariate datasets widely used for benchmarking efficient transformer models (Du et\u00a0al., \u301041\u20202022\u3011; Zhou et\u00a0al., \u301040\u20202021\u3011). In order to predict multivariate data with LLMTime, we forecast each covariate independently. We baseline against numbers obtained by running public implementations from the Autoformer (Wu et\u00a0al., \u301042\u20202021\u3011) and FEDFormer (Zhou et\u00a0al., \u301043\u20202022\u3011) codebases (Appendix \u301044\u2020C.3\u3011).\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] Figure 4: LLMTime with base model GPT-3 or LLaMA-2 70B has the best or second best aggregated performance on several deterministic time series benchmarks (Herzen et\u00a0al., \u301023\u20202022\u3011; Godahewa et\u00a0al., \u301034\u20202021\u3011; Zhou et\u00a0al., \u301040\u20202021\u3011) while being entirely zero-shot. Collectively, these benchmarks comprise 29 individual datasets with diverse sources, lengths, and noise levels. For Monash MAE numbers, established results are reported on unnormalized data, so we normalize values before aggregating (Appendix\u00a0\u301039\u2020C.2\u3011). The informer datasets are multivariate, and we predict each covariate independently with LLMTime (Appendix\u00a0\u301044\u2020C.3\u3011). GPT-3 evaluation on the Informer datasets was skipped because of the cost of API queries. Error bars show standard errors over the individual datasets in each benchmark.\n\nDeterministic results \u00a0\u00a0 To compute MAE values for LLMTime we use the pointwise median of 20 samples from the base model (GPT-2 or LLaMA-2 70B). Figure 4 shows that deterministic predictions from LLMTime are ranked best or second best on all the considered benchmarks while having no trainable parameters. We provide visualizations of the forecasts in Appendix\u00a0\u301045\u2020C.5\u3011/\u301046\u2020C.7\u3011/\u301047\u2020C.8\u3011.\n\nProbabilistic results \u00a0\u00a0 In Figure 5, we show several probabilistic evaluations on the Darts datasets, including aggregated NLL and CRPS numbers, as well as analysis of how each model reacts to decreasing the input data size. Evaluated on log likelihood and CRPS, LLMTime considerably outperforms the baselines in aggregate and on almost every individual dataset (results per dataset included in Appendix \u301045\u2020C.5\u3011). Given the analysis of language model-derived densities in Section \u301048\u20203\u3011, it is unsurprising that language models excel in probabilistic evaluations, outperforming the baselines even more dramatically. In Figure 5 (left) we show two informative examples that capture the performance of LLMTime. When extrapolating the AirPassengers dataset, LLMTime successfully identifies and continues trend and period components, with uncertainty that grows as predictions get further from the input data. On GasRateCO2, LLMTime replicates local structure when there is relatively little global structure. In Figure 5 (right) we show that LLMTime not only performs better than baselines with access to the full training data but also when restricted to small fractions of the training data. As time series is frequently characterized by relative data scarcity and challenges in transfer learning, the data efficiency of LLMs is especially attractive.\n\nComparison with PromptCast \u00a0\u00a0 Though included in the results described above, we want to explicitly highlight that LLMTime significantly outperforms PromptCast\u00a0(Xue and Salim, \u301022\u20202023\u3011) when applied to both GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 70B, according to CRPS and MAE aggregated over the Darts datasets. This performance gap highlights important differences between the two approaches. Unlike our method, PromptCast formulates forecasting as a conventional question-answering task in NLP by prompting pre-trained language models with an explicit question about future values in a time series. For example, PromptCast feeds in the prompt \u201cThe values in the WoolyDataset for the past 95 time steps are 6172, 6709, 6633, \u2026 , 6077. What will the values for the next 5 time steps be? The values for the next 5 time steps will be\", to extract predictions from an LLM. PromptCast also does not apply our tokenization and data rescaling strategy (Section\u00a0\u301048\u20203\u3011), which we show is crucial for good performance.\n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption] Figure 5: Extended experiments on the Darts datasets. (left): Example probabilistic forecasts with baseline negative log likelihood per dimension (NLL/D). LLMs easily extrapolate trends (e.g. AirPassengers) and reproduce local patterns when data is noisy (e.g. GasRateCO2). (center): When using probabilistic metrics like NLL and CRPS, LLMTime outperforms all baselines, including PromptCast (Xue and Salim, \u301022\u20202023\u3011), a competing LLM method. Error bars show standard errors over datasets with Darts. (right): LLMTime is much more sample efficient than competing methods. While the performance of other methods degrades rapidly when we restrict them to a fraction of the original training set, LLMTime can assign high likelihood with only a few examples.  \n\n###  5 Origins of Zero-Shot Performance\n\nTo understand why LLMs can extrapolate time series in a zero-shot manner, let\u2019s take a step back and consider simple numerical sequences, for example [] or []. For any input sequence, there are arbitrarily many generation rules that are consistent with the input (e.g. for ), but some generation rules are overly complex and will generalize poorly. LLMs can forecast effectively because they prefer completions derived from simple rules, adopting a form of Occam\u2019s razor prior (Goldblum et\u00a0al., \u30104\u20202023\u3011; Sutskever, \u30109\u20202023\u3011; Del\u00e9tang et\u00a0al., \u301010\u20202023\u3011). To explicitly demonstrate this phenomenon, we create a synthetic example using the function with additive Gaussian noise. We fit symbolic expressions to the first 70% of timesteps using PySR (Cranmer, \u301049\u20202023\u3011) with symbols [\"\", \"\", \"-\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\",\"square\"] to identify generating rules with known complexity, quantified by the number of symbols in the regressed expression (Appendix \u3010\nVisible: 0% - 28%", "summary": "[2310.07820] Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters (ar5iv.org)\n", "assets": []}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "metadata": {"_cite_metadata": {"citation_format": {"name": "tether_og"}, "metadata_list": [{"type": "webpage", "title": "[2310.07820] Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters", "url": "https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2310.07820.pdf", "text": "\nURL: https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2310.07820.pdf\n\\doparttoc\\faketableofcontents\n\n# Large Language Models Are   \nZero-Shot Time Series Forecasters\n\nNate Gruver   \nNYU &Marc Finzi   \nCMU &Shikai Qiu   \nNYU &Andrew Gordon Wilson   \nNYU Equal contribution\n\n###### Abstract\n\nBy encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach, we find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can surprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or exceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the downstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for effectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the success of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent multimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and repetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as repeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side information, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find that increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we show GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers, and poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment interventions such as RLHF.\n\n###  1 Introduction\n\nDespite similarities with other sequence modeling problems, such as text, audio, or video, time series has two particularly challenging properties. Unlike video or audio, which typically have consistent input scales and sampling rates, aggregated time series datasets often comprise sequences from radically different sources, sometimes with missing values. Moreover, common applications of time series forecasting, such as weather or financial data, require extrapolating from observations that contain a tiny fraction of the possible information, making accurate point predictions nearly impossible and uncertainty estimation especially important. While large-scale pretraining has become a key element of training large neural networks in vision and text, enabling performance to scale directly with data availability, pretraining is not typically used for time series modeling, where there is no consensus unsupervised objective and large, cohesive pretraining datasets are not readily available. Consequently, simple time series methods (e.g. ARIMA\u00a0(Box and Jenkins, 1968), and linear models\u00a0(Zeng et\u00a0al., 2022)) often outperform deep learning methods on popular benchmarks (Hewamalage et\u00a0al., 2023).\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate how large language models (LLM) can naturally bridge the gap between the simple biases of traditional methods and the complex representational learning and generative abilities of modern deep learning. In particular, we introduce an exceedingly simple method, LLMTime^{1}^{1}1https://github.com/ngruver/llmtime, to apply pretrained LLMs for continuous time series prediction problems, illustrated at a high level in Figure 1. At its core, this method represents the time series as a string of numerical digits, and views time series forecasting as next-token prediction in text, unlocking the use of powerful pretrained models and probabilistic capacities, such as likelihood evaluation and sampling. To enable strong performance, we propose techniques to (1) effectively encode time series as a string of numerical digits and (2) adapt the discrete distributions of LLMs to continuous densities capable of modeling sophisticated multimodal distributions. Using these techniques, we find LLMTime can exceed or match purpose-built time series methods over a range of different problems in a zero-shot fashion, meaning that LLMTime can be used without any fine-tuning on the downstream data used by other models.\n\nThe zero-shot nature of LLMTime carries several natural advantages: (1) it facilitates the straightforward application of LLMs, eliminating the necessity for specialized knowledge of fine-tuning procedures and the substantial computational resources required for these procedures, as well as side-stepping access issues surrounding proprietary source code or APIs for LLM training or fine-tuning; (2) it is naturally suited to scenarios with limited data availability, where there is little information for training or fine-tuning; (3) by leveraging the broad pattern extrapolation capabilities of extensively pre-trained LLMs, it circumvents the extensive time, effort, and domain-specific expertise typically required for crafting dedicated time series models.\n\nTo understand the origins of LLMTime\u2019s impressive performance, we investigate how LLMs express preferences for simple or repetitive sequences (Goldblum et\u00a0al., 2023) and show that these biases are in fact compatible with the salient structure of time series, such as seasonality. Aside from these biases, LLMs also can naturally acccommodate missing data, and express multimodal distributions, which is particularly useful for time series. We also show how LLMs enable appealing functionality, such as the ability to provide additional side information through prompting, and query the LLM to explain its predictions.\n\nFinally, in addition to broadly compelling forecasting performance, we find performance tends to improve with scale, and the quality of point predictions also improves with the quality of the uncertainty representation. However, we also find GPT-4 has worse uncertainty calibration than GPT-3, likely due to interventions such as reinforcement learning by human feedback (RLHF).\n\n[Image 0: Refer to caption] Figure 1: We propose LLMTime, a method for time series forecasting with large language models (LLMs) by encoding numbers as text and sampling possible extrapolations as text completions. LLMTime can outperform many popular time series methods without any training on the target dataset (i.e. zero-shot). The performance of LLMTime also scales with the power of the underlying base model. Notably, models that undergo alignment (e.g. RLHF) do not follow the scaling trend. For example, GPT-4 demonstrates inferior performance to GPT-3 (Section 6).  \n\n###  2 Background\n\nLanguage modeling \u00a0\u00a0 Language models are trained on a collection of sequences, , where and each token, , belongs to a vocabulary . Large language models typically encode an autoregressive distribution, in which the probability of each token is only dependent on the previous tokens in the sequence, . The parameters, , are learned by maximizing the probability of the entire dataset . Every language model has an associated tokenizer, which breaks an input string into a sequence of tokens, each belonging to . Proper tokenization is extremely important, and small details can have surprisingly significant effects. The most common tokenization method for autoregressive language models is byte-pair encoding (BPE), which treats inputs like bit strings and assigns tokens based on the rate of occurrence in the training corpus, optimizing for shorter sequences of tokens on average. Sampling from a language model typically starts with a prompt, , and proceeds sequentially using , which is often preprocessed, for example through temperature scaling or nucleus sampling (Holtzman et\u00a0al., 2019).\n\nLarge language models \u00a0\u00a0 Brown et\u00a0al. (2020) showed that increasing a language model\u2019s parameter count and training data size leads to new capabilities such as zero-shot generalization, in which a model can perform a text-formatted task without training the model parameters on any task-specific data. Large language models, for example GPT-3 (Brown et\u00a0al., 2020) or LLaMA-2 (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b), accomplish this form of generalization through in-context learning, which identifies patterns in the language model\u2019s prompt and extrapolates them through next-token prediction. Many authors have speculated that in-context learning emerges from a language model\u2019s extensive compression of the input data (Goldblum et\u00a0al., 2023; Sutskever, 2023; Del\u00e9tang et\u00a0al., 2023). Compression favors learning algorithms that operate over the input data with programmatic abstractions, for example, context-free grammars (Allen-Zhu and Li, 2023) or induction heads (Olsson et\u00a0al., 2022), which can implement copy-and-paste type operations for generating samples with highly structured syntax. In this work, we show that the zero-shot generalization abilities of LLMs and their preference for compressible patterns extend well beyond language understanding and can be used for time series forecasting.\n\nZero-shot generalization has made LLMs significantly more useful as assistants, leading to the create of methods to align LLMs with human preferences and instructions, for example reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022) and instruction tuning (Wei et\u00a0al., 2021). While key to modern LLMs products, alignment methods can also significantly affect the abilities and calibration of the underlying model (OpenAI, 2023; Bubeck et\u00a0al., 2023). Here we show these methods can also affect forecasting ability.\n\nTime series data \u00a0\u00a0 Time series data typically takes the exact same form as language modeling data, as a collection of sequences , but in time series is numerical. Because language models are built to represent complex probability distributions over sequences, they are theoretically well-suited for time series modeling. In practice, however, language models are held back by the details of tokenizing numbers. BPE compresses numbers based on frequency of occurrence in the training data, so numbers can be broken down into awkward chunks that make learning basic numerical operations challenging. Touvron et\u00a0al. (2023a) therefore designed the LLaMA tokenizer to map numbers to individual digits, which can lead to significant improvements in mathematical abilities, with small LLaMA models outperforming GPT-4 (Liu and Low, 2023).\n\nThe other challenge of applying language models to time series data is proper evaluation. Mean absolute error (MAE) is commonly used but ignores uncertainty in the forecast which is highly limiting for stochastic data (Hewamalage et\u00a0al., 2023; Benton et\u00a0al., 2022). Continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) captures distributional qualities and can compare models that generate samples without likelihoods. For a single prediction, the CRPS score is defined against the estimated cumulative distribution function (CDF), as where is the empirical CDF produced by sampling forecasts and is the indicator function. While CRPS is an improvement over MAE, it also ignores key structures in the data, such as correlations between time steps. Fortunately, language models can assign likelihoods to full sequences of time series data, and we show how a small modification to an LLM\u2019s discrete likelihood can yield a continuous density that is useful for model comparison.\n\nLanguage models for time series \u00a0\u00a0 Several authors have explored using pretrained language model encoders as initializations for time series models. For example, Zhou et\u00a0al. (2023) propose FPT, which finetunes a BERT encoder to perform time series forecasting. Similarly, Zhang et\u00a0al. (2023) introduce Meta-Transformer, a framework for finetuning a language model for non-text modalities, including time series. Fewer papers explore using LLMs as forecasters without finetuning. The only method we are aware of is PromptCast\u00a0(Xue and Salim, 2023), which poses forecasting as question answering with prompting.\n\nOur work \u00a0\u00a0 Unlike methods that leverage LLM backbones, our method is entirely zero-shot and does not require finetuning. Unlike PromptCast, we show that LLMs can be used directly as forecasters without any added text or prompt engineering, if we carefully preprocess the numerical values themselves. Our method solely relies on LLM\u2019s abilities to extrapolate patterns in general sequences and nothing particular to English or any other language. Going beyond prior work, we also cultivate the probabilistic nature of large language models and their ability to capture uncertainty over highly stochastic time series.\n\n###  3 LLMTime: Forecasting with Language Models\n\nForecasting with LLMTime has relatively few steps. Once the numerical values are processed into strings, making predictions with the language model follows standard sampling procedures. As we show next, however, correct pre-processing is not always intuitive but is extremely important, and incorrect handling can lead to unusable predictions.\n\nTokenization \u00a0\u00a0 Tokenization is particularly important because it directly influences how patterns form within tokenized sequences and the types of operations that language models can learn. Unfortunately, common tokenization methods like BPE tend to break a single number into tokens that don\u2019t align with the digits, which can make arithmetic considerably more difficult (Liu and Low, 2023). For example, the number gets tokenized as by the GPT-3 tokenizer, and changes by even a single digit can result in an entirely different tokenization. By contrast, in many new open-source LLMs (e.g. LLaMA (Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023a)), numbers are tokenized into individual digits by default. To remedy the tokenization of GPT models, we separate the digits with spaces to force a separate tokenization of each digit and use a comma (\" ,\") to separate each time step in a time series. Because decimal points are redundant given a fixed precision, we drop them in the encoding to save on context length. Thus, with e.g. digits of precision, we pre-process a time series as follows before feeding into the tokenizer:\n\nIn Figure 2, we show that the added spaces of this encoding are helpful for GPT models, preventing the model from getting derailed by outputting an unusual token during sampling. For LLaMA models, with their unique tokenization of numbers, added spaces have the opposite effect. Each digit and space is already assigned its own token, and space tokens become nuisance inputs, adding to the sequence length without simplifying the sequence\u2019s structure and potentially making the sequence out-of-distribution to the model.\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 2: Careful tokenization is important for good forecasting with LLMs. Using the Australian Wine dataset from Darts (Herzen et\u00a0al., 2022), with values [151, 167, \u2026, 267], we show the tokenization used by GPT-3\u00a0(Brown et\u00a0al., 2020) and LLaMA-2\u00a0(Touvron et\u00a0al., 2023b) and the corresponding effect on forecasting performance. Added spaces allow GPT-3 to create one token per digit, leading to good performance. LLaMA-2, on the other hand, tokenizes digits individually, and adding spaces hurts performance.\n\nRescaling \u00a0\u00a0 To avoid wasting tokens when the inputs are very large, we scale values down so that the -percentile of rescaled time series values is . We avoid scaling by the maximum value so that the LLM can see some fraction of examples () where the number of digits changes and reproduce this behavior in its outputs to produce larger values than it has seen. We also experiment with an offset based calculate as a percentile of the input data, and we tune these two parameters on validation log likelihoods (details in Appendix A).\n\nSampling / Forecasting \u00a0\u00a0 To forecast, draw many samples (e.g. 20) from the LLM and use the statistics of the samples at each time step to construct a point estimate (e.g. as the median) or probabilistic forecast (e.g. as quantiles). To control sampling, we use temperature scaling, logit bias, and nucleus sampling (Appendix C).\n\nContinuous likelihoods \u00a0\u00a0 Modeling sequences of individual digits has additional benefits beyond good samples. With digits of precision in base , each sequence of digits after the decimal place corresponds to one of possible bins (Figure 3), each with width . As each distribution is a softmax over possible digits, we can view the distribution over each individual number as a hierarchical softmax (Mnih and Hinton, 2008), with . Though a language model\u2019s probability distribution is discrete, we can easily adapt it to provide a continuous density by placing a uniform distribution in each bin. Enumerating each of the countably infinite numbers that the model can produce (because the model can output an arbitrary number of digits before the decimal point) with an index each with probability , we can write out the distribution as a mixture of disjoint uniform distributions over the bins where . Therefore if a given data point lies in bin , its continuous log likelihood is . Finally, to obtain the likelihood in the original input space, we add a change of variables factor where is the rescaling operation in the pre-processing. As a result, the exponentially large number of bins and exponentially small bin widths enabled by our construction make it surprisingly efficient to represent flexible and high-resolution continuous distributions with LLMs, despite using a discrete tokenization of numbers.\n\nLanguage models as flexible distributions \u00a0\u00a0 The fact that LLMs can express flexible distributions over numbers is key for time series data. Uncertainty quantification is essential to forecasting, and typical approaches to representing uncertainty in time series can be limited by misspecification. For example, one common method for creating a probabilistic forecast is to fit a Gaussian or Laplace observation model. When the underlying data distribution is multimodal, both of these models will perform poorly. Methods like Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) solve the issue of multimodality but introduce additional challenges to optimization and model selection. We show that a language model is an underrated solution by training a small autoregressive model on a variety of one-dimensional distributions shown in Figure 3 (right). These distributions come from an exponential random variable, a mixture of a uniform and a student-t distribution, and the heavy-tailed distribution of time series prediction residuals from an ARIMA model on the MonthlyMilk dataset (Herzen et\u00a0al., 2022). We evaluate these fits quantitatively by computing Wasserstein distances, and compare to a Laplace observation model, a GMM trained with expectation-maximization, and logistic regression over a flat binning of the data (with a tuned bin size). Each model is trained with only samples from the distribution. The results show that the decimal autoregressive language model (\u201cDecimal AR\u201d) performs extremely well, handling asymmetric, multimodal, and heavy-tailed distributions, which are among the diverse types characteristic of time series data.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption]\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 3: (left): Autoregressive models over sequences of digits act like hierarchical softmax distributions over the corresponding numbers. When combined with uniform distributions in each discrete bucket, distributions over strings can become expressive distributions over continuous domains (right): Using simple autoregressive models (e.g. RNNs) trained on a string representation of numbers, we can fit complex distributions that can be challenging for other methods, such as heavy-tailed or multimodal distributions. A simple autoregressive model can match or outperform well-known methods for density estimation, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) or binning with a fixed resolution, as measured by Wasserstein distance between samples.  \n\n###  4 Experiments\n\nWe evaluate the zero-shot forecasting ability of LLMs by comparing LLMTime with GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 70B to many popular time series baselines on a variety of benchmark time series datasets. Not only is LLMTime able to generate plausible completions of the real and synthetic time series, it achieves higher likelihoods and CRPS values in zero-shot evaluation than the dedicated time series models like ARIMA, TCNs, and N-HiTS. When evaluated on deterministic metrics like MAE, LLMs also perform well, obtain the best or second best MAE values on each benchmark. As we are using LLMs with undisclosed datasets, data leakage is an important concern that we address directly in Appendix\u00a0B. Beyond strong performance on standard benchmarks, which are the most useful for comparison, we find that LLMTime also performs well on datasets that could not have been present in the base model\u2019s training data. The full set of hyperparameters used for LLMTime and the baseline methods are detailed in Appendix C.1. For some of the longer time series, not all of the history can be fit into the context window, and hence hyperparameters implicitly capture the trade-off between higher precision and capturing a larger temporal history.\n\nDatasets \u00a0\u00a0 We use three benchmark datasets that are common within deep learning research and many baseline methods that accompany the benchmark datasets.\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nDarts (Herzen et\u00a0al., 2022): A collection of 8 real univariate time series datasets. For Darts, we use several methods that are implemented directly in the package, including neural network models (TCN\u00a0(Lea et\u00a0al., 2016), N-BEATS\u00a0(Oreshkin et\u00a0al., 2020), N-HiTS\u00a0(Challu et\u00a0al., 2022)) and simple moving average models (ARIMA (Box and Jenkins, 1968)). Darts enables learning observation models with tractable likelihoods and is therefore especially useful for benchmarking the probabilistic predictions of LLMTime. We also include Spectral Mixture Gaussian Process (SM-GP) (Wilson and Adams, 2013), a Bayesian nonparametric method (details in Appendix\u00a0C.1).\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nMonash\u00a0(Godahewa et\u00a0al., 2021): The Monash forecasting archive contains 30 publicly available datasets along with baseline numbers for 12 forecasting models, including simple exponential smooth (e.g. ETS (Hyndman et\u00a0al., 2008)), gradient boosting (e.g. CatBoost (Prokhorenkova et\u00a0al., 2018)) and deep learning models (e.g. DeepAR (Salinas et\u00a0al., 2020), WaveNet (Oord et\u00a0al., 2016)). The Monash archive comprises over 400,000 individual time series, making it infeasible to use in its entirety with the largest available LLMs. To reduce the computational burden, we evaluate GPT-3\u2019s zero-shot performance on the top 16 datasets where the baseline models perform the best (details in Appendix\u00a0C.2).\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nInformer\u00a0(Zhou et\u00a0al., 2021): We evaluated on multivariate datasets widely used for benchmarking efficient transformer models (Du et\u00a0al., 2022; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2021). In order to predict multivariate data with LLMTime, we forecast each covariate independently. We baseline against numbers obtained by running public implementations from the Autoformer (Wu et\u00a0al., 2021) and FEDFormer (Zhou et\u00a0al., 2022) codebases (Appendix C.3).\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] Figure 4: LLMTime with base model GPT-3 or LLaMA-2 70B has the best or second best aggregated performance on several deterministic time series benchmarks (Herzen et\u00a0al., 2022; Godahewa et\u00a0al., 2021; Zhou et\u00a0al., 2021) while being entirely zero-shot. Collectively, these benchmarks comprise 29 individual datasets with diverse sources, lengths, and noise levels. For Monash MAE numbers, established results are reported on unnormalized data, so we normalize values before aggregating (Appendix\u00a0C.2). The informer datasets are multivariate, and we predict each covariate independently with LLMTime (Appendix\u00a0C.3). GPT-3 evaluation on the Informer datasets was skipped because of the cost of API queries. Error bars show standard errors over the individual datasets in each benchmark.\n\nDeterministic results \u00a0\u00a0 To compute MAE values for LLMTime we use the pointwise median of 20 samples from the base model (GPT-2 or LLaMA-2 70B). Figure 4 shows that deterministic predictions from LLMTime are ranked best or second best on all the considered benchmarks while having no trainable parameters. We provide visualizations of the forecasts in Appendix\u00a0C.5/C.7/C.8.\n\nProbabilistic results \u00a0\u00a0 In Figure 5, we show several probabilistic evaluations on the Darts datasets, including aggregated NLL and CRPS numbers, as well as analysis of how each model reacts to decreasing the input data size. Evaluated on log likelihood and CRPS, LLMTime considerably outperforms the baselines in aggregate and on almost every individual dataset (results per dataset included in Appendix C.5). Given the analysis of language model-derived densities in Section 3, it is unsurprising that language models excel in probabilistic evaluations, outperforming the baselines even more dramatically. In Figure 5 (left) we show two informative examples that capture the performance of LLMTime. When extrapolating the AirPassengers dataset, LLMTime successfully identifies and continues trend and period components, with uncertainty that grows as predictions get further from the input data. On GasRateCO2, LLMTime replicates local structure when there is relatively little global structure. In Figure 5 (right) we show that LLMTime not only performs better than baselines with access to the full training data but also when restricted to small fractions of the training data. As time series is frequently characterized by relative data scarcity and challenges in transfer learning, the data efficiency of LLMs is especially attractive.\n\nComparison with PromptCast \u00a0\u00a0 Though included in the results described above, we want to explicitly highlight that LLMTime significantly outperforms PromptCast\u00a0(Xue and Salim, 2023) when applied to both GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 70B, according to CRPS and MAE aggregated over the Darts datasets. This performance gap highlights important differences between the two approaches. Unlike our method, PromptCast formulates forecasting as a conventional question-answering task in NLP by prompting pre-trained language models with an explicit question about future values in a time series. For example, PromptCast feeds in the prompt \u201cThe values in the WoolyDataset for the past 95 time steps are 6172, 6709, 6633, \u2026 , 6077. What will the values for the next 5 time steps be? The values for the next 5 time steps will be\", to extract predictions from an LLM. PromptCast also does not apply our tokenization and data rescaling strategy (Section\u00a03), which we show is crucial for good performance.\n\n[Image 5: Refer to caption] Figure 5: Extended experiments on the Darts datasets. (left): Example probabilistic forecasts with baseline negative log likelihood per dimension (NLL/D). LLMs easily extrapolate trends (e.g. AirPassengers) and reproduce local patterns when data is noisy (e.g. GasRateCO2). (center): When using probabilistic metrics like NLL and CRPS, LLMTime outperforms all baselines, including PromptCast (Xue and Salim, 2023), a competing LLM method. Error bars show standard errors over datasets with Darts. (right): LLMTime is much more sample efficient than competing methods. While the performance of other methods degrades rapidly when we restrict them to a fraction of the original training set, LLMTime can assign high likelihood with only a few examples.  \n\n###  5 Origins of Zero-Shot Performance\n\nTo understand why LLMs can extrapolate time series in a zero-shot manner, let\u2019s take a step back and consider simple numerical sequences, for example [] or []. For any input sequence, there are arbitrarily many generation rules that are consistent with the input (e.g. for ), but some generation rules are overly complex and will generalize poorly. LLMs can forecast effectively because they prefer completions derived from simple rules, adopting a form of Occam\u2019s razor prior (Goldblum et\u00a0al., 2023; Sutskever, 2023; Del\u00e9tang et\u00a0al., 2023). To explicitly demonstrate this phenomenon, we create a synthetic example using the function with additive Gaussian noise. We fit symbolic expressions to the first 70% of timesteps using PySR (Cranmer, 2023) with symbols [\"\", \"\", \"-\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\",\"square\"] to identify generating rules with known complexity, quantified by the number of symbols in the regressed expression (Appendix \nVisible: 0% - 28%", "pub_date": null, "extra": null}], "original_query": null}, "command": "open_url", "args": ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07820.pdf"], "status": "finished", "is_complete": true, "message_type": null, "model_slug": "gpt-4", "parent_id": "62d38bd1-58a7-4b59-ae49-2a60c8fca8ce", "request_id": "851469b39bcb6ef1-CDG", "timestamp_": "absolute"}, "recipient": "all"}, "parent": "62d38bd1-58a7-4b59-ae49-2a60c8fca8ce", "children": ["fc82bd04-ca9e-430a-b327-14356153beb2"]}, "fc82bd04-ca9e-430a-b327-14356153beb2": {"id": "fc82bd04-ca9e-430a-b327-14356153beb2", "message": {"id": "fc82bd04-ca9e-430a-b327-14356153beb2", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null, "metadata": {}}, "create_time": 1707233220.106908, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["- [Large Language Models Are Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07820.pdf)\n\nThe paper demonstrates that large language models like GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can zero-shot forecast time series by encoding the data as strings of numbers, enabling performance comparable to or exceeding specialized time series models without requiring task-specific training.

GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SWA is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost, thereby alleviating a common limitation in LLMs. These attention mechanisms collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of Mistral\u00a07B.\n\nMistral\u00a07B is released under the Apache 2.0 license. This release is accompanied by a reference implementation^{1}^{1}1\u30100\u2020https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src\u2020github.com\u3011 facilitating easy deployment either locally or on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure using the vLLM\u00a0\u30108\u2020kwon2023efficient \u3011 inference server and SkyPilot\u00a0^{2}^{2}2\u30109\u2020https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot\u2020github.com\u3011. Integration with Hugging Face\u00a0^{3}^{3}3\u301010\u2020https://huggingface.co/mistralai\u2020huggingface.co\u3011 is also streamlined for easier integration. Moreover, Mistral\u00a07B is crafted for ease of fine-tuning across a myriad of tasks. As a demonstration of its adaptability and superior performance, we present a chat model fine-tuned from Mistral\u00a07B that significantly outperforms the Llama 2 13B \u2013 Chat model.\n\nMistral\u00a07B takes a significant step in balancing the goals of getting high performance while keeping large language models efficient. Through our work, our aim is to help the community create more affordable, efficient, and high-performing language models that can be used in a wide range of real-world applications.\n\n##  2 Architectural details\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 1: Sliding Window Attention. The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most tokens from the previous layer (here, ). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by tokens. Hence, after attention layers, information can move forward by up to tokens.  \n\n   Parameter Value  \n dim  \n n_layers  \n head_dim  \n hidden_dim  \n n_heads  \n n_kv_heads  \n window_size  \n context_len  \n vocab_size  \n\n Table 1: Model architecture.\n\nMistral\u00a07B is based on a transformer architecture\u00a0\u301011\u2020vaswani2017attention \u3011. The main parameters of the architecture are summarized in Table\u00a0\u301012\u20201\u3011. Compared to Llama, it introduces a few changes that we summarize below.\n\nSliding Window Attention. SWA exploits the stacked layers of a transformer to attend information beyond the window size . The hidden state in position of the layer , , attends to all hidden states from the previous layer with positions between and . Recursively, can access tokens from the input layer at a distance of up to tokens, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01. At the last layer, using a window size of , we have a theoretical attention span of approximately tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K and , changes made to FlashAttention\u00a0\u301013\u2020dao2022flashattention \u3011 and xFormers\u00a0\u301014\u2020xFormers2022 \u3011 yield a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline.\n\nRolling Buffer Cache. A fixed attention span means that we can limit our cache size using a rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of , and the keys and values for the timestep are stored in position of the cache. As a result, when the position is larger than , past values in the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops increasing. We provide an illustration in Figure\u00a0\u301015\u20202\u3011 for . On a sequence length of 32k tokens, this reduces the cache memory usage by 8x, without impacting the model quality.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 2: Rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of . Keys and values for position are stored in position of the cache. When the position is larger than , past values in the cache are overwritten. The hidden state corresponding to the latest generated tokens are colored in orange. \n\nPre-fill and Chunking. When generating a sequence, we need to predict tokens one-by-one, as each token is conditioned on the previous ones. However, the prompt is known in advance, and we can pre-fill the (, ) cache with the prompt. If the prompt is very large, we can chunk it into smaller pieces, and pre-fill the cache with each chunk. For this purpose, we can select the window size as our chunk size. For each chunk, we thus need to compute the attention over the cache and over the chunk. Figure\u00a03 shows how the attention mask works over both the cache and the chunk.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 3:  Pre-fill and chunking. During pre-fill of the cache, long sequences are chunked to limit memory usage. We process a sequence in three chunks, \u201cThe cat sat on\u201d, \u201cthe mat and saw\u201d, \u201cthe dog go to\u201d. The figure shows what happens for the third chunk (\u201cthe dog go to\u201d): it attends itself using a causal mask (rightmost block), attends the cache using a sliding window (center block), and does not attend to past tokens as they are outside of the sliding window (left block).   \n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe compare Mistral\u00a07B to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison.

Figure\u00a04 compares the performance of Mistral\u00a07B with Llama 2 7B/13B, and Llama 1 34B^{4}^{4}4 Since Llama 2 34B was not open-sourced, we report results for Llama 1 34B. in different categories. Mistral\u00a07B surpasses Llama 2 13B across all metrics, and outperforms Llama\u00a01\u00a034B on most benchmarks. In particular, Mistral\u00a07B displays a superior performance in code, mathematics, and reasoning benchmarks.\n\nSize and Efficiency. We computed \u201cequivalent model sizes\u201d of the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mistral\u00a07B models\u2019 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure\u00a05). When evaluated on reasoning, comprehension, and STEM reasoning (specifically MMLU), Mistral\u00a07B mirrored performance that one might expect from a Llama 2 model with more than 3x its size. On the Knowledge benchmarks, Mistral\u00a07B\u2019s performance achieves a lower compression rate of 1.9x, which is likely due to its limited parameter count that restricts the amount of knowledge it can store.\n\nEvaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] Figure 4: Performance of Mistral\u00a07B and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks. All models were re-evaluated on all metrics with our evaluation pipeline for accurate comparison. Mistral\u00a07B significantly outperforms Llama 2 7B and Llama 2 13B on all benchmarks. It is also vastly superior to Llama 1 34B in mathematics, code generation, and reasoning benchmarks.

No proprietary data or training tricks were utilized: Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct model is a simple and preliminary demonstration that the base model can easily be fine-tuned to achieve good performance. In Table\u00a0\u301035\u20203\u3011, we observe that the resulting model, Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, exhibits superior performance compared to all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B \u2013 Chat models. An independent human evaluation was conducted on \u301036\u2020https://llmboxing.com/leaderboard\u2020llmboxing.com\u3011.\n\nIn this evaluation, participants were provided with a set of questions along with anonymous responses from two models and were asked to select their preferred response, as illustrated in Figure\u00a06. As of October 6, 2023, the outputs generated by Mistral 7B were preferred 5020 times, compared to 4143 times for Llama 2 13B.\n\n##  5 Adding guardrails for front-facing applications\n\nThe ability to enforce guardrails when it comes to AI generation is important for front-facing applications. In this section, we highlight how to leverage system prompting to optionally enforce output constraints on top of our models. Additionally, we showcase the ability of Mistral\u00a07B to perform fine-grained content moderation, which can be useful to enforce quality content in applications.\n\n###  5.1 System prompt to enforce guardrails\n\nWe introduce a system prompt (see below) to guide the model to generate answers within specified guardrails, similar to the work done with Llama 2. Using this prompt allows the user to move on the Pareto front of model utility / guardrails enforcement, as indicated in Table\u00a0\u301037\u20204\u3011.\n\n  Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity.\n\n   Guardrails MT Bench  \n No system prompt  6.84  0.07  \n Llama 2 system prompt  6.38  0.07  \n Mistral system prompt  6.58  0.05  \n\n Table 4: System prompts. Mean official MT Bench score over 10 iterations with standard deviation for Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct. For reference, Llama 2 13B \u2013 Chat reports official results of 6.65.\n\nWe use a set of 175 unsafe prompts for evaluating safety. With the recommended system prompt, the model properly declines to answer 100% of the harmful questions.\n\nAs an illustration, we provide in Table\u00a0\u301038\u20205\u3011 the answers of both Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct and Llama 2 Chat 13B to the question How to kill a linux process with system prompts activated. We observe that Mistral\u00a07B provides a correct response while Llama 2 declines to answer. Note that on this specific question, both models answer correctly when system prompts are deactivated.\n\n    Model Answer  \n    Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct  \n with Mistral system prompt  \n   To kill a Linux process, you can use the `kill`command followed by the process ID (PID)  \n of the process you want to terminate. For example, to kill process with PID 1234, you  \n would run the command `kill 1234`. It\u2019s important to note that killing a process can  \n have unintended consequences, so it\u2019s generally a good idea to only kill processes that  \n you are certain you want to terminate. Additionally, it\u2019s generally a good idea to use the  \n `kill`command with caution, as it can be used to terminate critical system processes that  \n are necessary for the operation of the system.  \n    Llama 2 13B \u2013 Chat  \n with Llama 2 system prompt  \n   As a helpful and respectful assistant, I cannot provide information on how to kill a Linux  \n process. It is not appropriate or ethical to intentionally harm or terminate processes, as it  \n can cause damage to the system and potentially result in data loss. Additionally, it is  \n important to respect the autonomy and security of other users\u2019 processes, as they may be  \n critical to their work or personal activities. Instead, I suggest that you explore other  \n options to address any issues or concerns you may have.  \nTable 5:  Comparison between Mistral and Llama system prompts. Mistral provides the right answer whereas Llama\u00a02 declines to answer to the question How to kill a linux process.   \n\n###  5.2 Content moderation with self-reflection\n\nMistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct can be used as a content moderator: the model itself is able to accurately classify a user prompt or its generated answer as being either acceptable or falling into one of the following categories: Illegal activities such as terrorism, child abuse or fraud; Hateful, harassing or violent content such as discrimination, self-harm or bullying; Unqualified advice for instance in legal, medical or financial domains.\n\nTo do so, we designed a self-reflection prompt that makes Mistral\u00a07B classify a prompt or a generated answer. We evaluated self-reflection on our manually curated and balanced dataset of adversarial and standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable prompts as positives).\n\nThe use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring on the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively filter based on their particular use-case.\n\n##  6 Conclusion\n\nOur work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than what was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the emphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as in \u301039\u2020hoffmann2022compute \u3011); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and much remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster.

Mistral\u00a07B outperforms the best open 13B model (Llama 2) across all evaluated benchmarks, and the best released 34B model (Llama 1) in reasoning, mathematics, and code generation. Our model leverages grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference, coupled with sliding window attention (SWA) to effectively handle sequences of arbitrary length with a reduced inference cost. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, that surpasses Llama\u00a02\u00a013B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0chat model both on human and automated benchmarks. Our models are released under the Apache 2.0 license.   \nCode: https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src   \nWebpage: https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b/\n\n [Image 0: [Uncaptioned image]] \n\n##  1 Introduction\n\nIn the rapidly evolving domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the race towards higher model performance often necessitates an escalation in model size. However, this scaling tends to increase computational costs and inference latency, thereby raising barriers to deployment in practical, real-world scenarios. In this context, the search for balanced models delivering both high-level performance and efficiency becomes critically essential. Our model, Mistral\u00a07B, demonstrates that a carefully designed language model can deliver high performance while maintaining an efficient inference. Mistral\u00a07B outperforms the previous best 13B model (Llama 2, touvron2023llama2 ) across all tested benchmarks, and surpasses the best 34B model (LLaMa 34B,\u00a0touvron2023llama ) in mathematics and code generation. Furthermore, Mistral\u00a07B approaches the coding performance of Code-Llama 7B\u00a0roziere2023code , without sacrificing performance on non-code related benchmarks.\n\nMistral\u00a07B leverages grouped-query attention (GQA)\u00a0ainslie2023gqa , and sliding window attention (SWA)\u00a0child2019generating ; beltagy2020longformer . GQA significantly accelerates the inference speed, and also reduces the memory requirement during decoding, allowing for higher batch sizes hence higher throughput, a crucial factor for real-time applications. In addition, SWA is designed to handle longer sequences more effectively at a reduced computational cost, thereby alleviating a common limitation in LLMs. These attention mechanisms collectively contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of Mistral\u00a07B.\n\nMistral\u00a07B is released under the Apache 2.0 license. This release is accompanied by a reference implementation^{1}^{1}1https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src facilitating easy deployment either locally or on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure using the vLLM\u00a0kwon2023efficient  inference server and SkyPilot\u00a0^{2}^{2}2https://github.com/skypilot-org/skypilot. Integration with Hugging Face\u00a0^{3}^{3}3https://huggingface.co/mistralai is also streamlined for easier integration. Moreover, Mistral\u00a07B is crafted for ease of fine-tuning across a myriad of tasks. As a demonstration of its adaptability and superior performance, we present a chat model fine-tuned from Mistral\u00a07B that significantly outperforms the Llama 2 13B \u2013 Chat model.\n\nMistral\u00a07B takes a significant step in balancing the goals of getting high performance while keeping large language models efficient. Through our work, our aim is to help the community create more affordable, efficient, and high-performing language models that can be used in a wide range of real-world applications.\n\n##  2 Architectural details\n\n[Image 1: Refer to caption] Figure 1: Sliding Window Attention. The number of operations in vanilla attention is quadratic in the sequence length, and the memory increases linearly with the number of tokens. At inference time, this incurs higher latency and smaller throughput due to reduced cache availability. To alleviate this issue, we use sliding window attention: each token can attend to at most tokens from the previous layer (here, ). Note that tokens outside the sliding window still influence next word prediction. At each attention layer, information can move forward by tokens. Hence, after attention layers, information can move forward by up to tokens.  \n\n   Parameter Value  \n dim  \n n_layers  \n head_dim  \n hidden_dim  \n n_heads  \n n_kv_heads  \n window_size  \n context_len  \n vocab_size  \n\n Table 1: Model architecture.\n\nMistral\u00a07B is based on a transformer architecture\u00a0vaswani2017attention . The main parameters of the architecture are summarized in Table\u00a01. Compared to Llama, it introduces a few changes that we summarize below.\n\nSliding Window Attention. SWA exploits the stacked layers of a transformer to attend information beyond the window size . The hidden state in position of the layer , , attends to all hidden states from the previous layer with positions between and . Recursively, can access tokens from the input layer at a distance of up to tokens, as illustrated in Figure\u00a01. At the last layer, using a window size of , we have a theoretical attention span of approximately tokens. In practice, for a sequence length of 16K and , changes made to FlashAttention\u00a0dao2022flashattention  and xFormers\u00a0xFormers2022  yield a 2x speed improvement over a vanilla attention baseline.\n\nRolling Buffer Cache. A fixed attention span means that we can limit our cache size using a rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of , and the keys and values for the timestep are stored in position of the cache. As a result, when the position is larger than , past values in the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops increasing. We provide an illustration in Figure\u00a02 for . On a sequence length of 32k tokens, this reduces the cache memory usage by 8x, without impacting the model quality.\n\n[Image 2: Refer to caption]\n\nFigure 2: Rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of . Keys and values for position are stored in position of the cache. When the position is larger than , past values in the cache are overwritten. The hidden state corresponding to the latest generated tokens are colored in orange. \n\nPre-fill and Chunking. When generating a sequence, we need to predict tokens one-by-one, as each token is conditioned on the previous ones. However, the prompt is known in advance, and we can pre-fill the (, ) cache with the prompt. If the prompt is very large, we can chunk it into smaller pieces, and pre-fill the cache with each chunk. For this purpose, we can select the window size as our chunk size. For each chunk, we thus need to compute the attention over the cache and over the chunk. Figure\u00a03 shows how the attention mask works over both the cache and the chunk.\n\n[Image 3: Refer to caption] Figure 3:  Pre-fill and chunking. During pre-fill of the cache, long sequences are chunked to limit memory usage. We process a sequence in three chunks, \u201cThe cat sat on\u201d, \u201cthe mat and saw\u201d, \u201cthe dog go to\u201d. The figure shows what happens for the third chunk (\u201cthe dog go to\u201d): it attends itself using a causal mask (rightmost block), attends the cache using a sliding window (center block), and does not attend to past tokens as they are outside of the sliding window (left block).   \n\n##  3 Results\n\nWe compare Mistral\u00a07B to Llama, and re-run all benchmarks with our own evaluation pipeline for fair comparison. We measure performance on a wide variety of tasks categorized as follow:\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nCommonsense Reasoning (0-shot): Hellaswag\u00a0zellers2019hellaswag , Winogrande\u00a0sakaguchi2021winogrande , PIQA\u00a0bisk2020piqa , SIQA\u00a0sap2019socialiqa , OpenbookQA\u00a0mihaylov2018can , ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge\u00a0clark2018think , CommonsenseQA\u00a0talmor2018commonsenseqa \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nWorld Knowledge (5-shot): NaturalQuestions\u00a0kwiatkowski2019natural , TriviaQA\u00a0joshi2017triviaqa \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nReading Comprehension (0-shot): BoolQ\u00a0clark2019boolq , QuAC\u00a0choi2018quac \n\n  *  \u2022\n\nMath: GSM8K\u00a0cobbe2021training  (8-shot) with maj@8 and MATH\u00a0hendrycks2021measuring  (4-shot) with maj@4\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nCode: Humaneval\u00a0chen2021evaluating  (0-shot) and MBPP\u00a0austin2021program  (3-shot)\n\n  *  \u2022\n\nPopular aggregated results: MMLU\u00a0hendrycks2020measuring  (5-shot), BBH\u00a0suzgun2022challenging  (3-shot), and AGI Eval\u00a0zhong2023agieval  (3-5-shot, English multiple-choice questions only)\n\nDetailed results for Mistral\u00a07B, Llama 2 7B/13B, and Code-Llama 7B are reported in Table\u00a02. Figure\u00a04 compares the performance of Mistral\u00a07B with Llama 2 7B/13B, and Llama 1 34B^{4}^{4}4 Since Llama 2 34B was not open-sourced, we report results for Llama 1 34B. in different categories. Mistral\u00a07B surpasses Llama 2 13B across all metrics, and outperforms Llama\u00a01\u00a034B on most benchmarks. In particular, Mistral\u00a07B displays a superior performance in code, mathematics, and reasoning benchmarks.\n\nSize and Efficiency. We computed \u201cequivalent model sizes\u201d of the Llama 2 family, aiming to understand Mistral\u00a07B models\u2019 efficiency in the cost-performance spectrum (see Figure\u00a05). When evaluated on reasoning, comprehension, and STEM reasoning (specifically MMLU), Mistral\u00a07B mirrored performance that one might expect from a Llama 2 model with more than 3x its size. On the Knowledge benchmarks, Mistral\u00a07B\u2019s performance achieves a lower compression rate of 1.9x, which is likely due to its limited parameter count that restricts the amount of knowledge it can store.\n\nEvaluation Differences. On some benchmarks, there are some differences between our evaluation protocol and the one reported in the Llama 2 paper: 1) on MBPP, we use the hand-verified subset 2) on TriviaQA, we do not provide Wikipedia contexts.\n\n[Image 4: Refer to caption] Figure 4: Performance of Mistral\u00a07B and different Llama models on a wide range of benchmarks. All models were re-evaluated on all metrics with our evaluation pipeline for accurate comparison. Mistral\u00a07B significantly outperforms Llama 2 7B and Llama 2 13B on all benchmarks. It is also vastly superior to Llama 1 34B in mathematics, code generation, and reasoning benchmarks.

[Image 5: Refer to caption] Figure 5: Results on MMLU, commonsense reasoning, world knowledge and reading comprehension for Mistral\u00a07B and Llama 2 (7B/13B/70B). Mistral\u00a07B largely outperforms Llama 2 13B on all evaluations, except on knowledge benchmarks, where it is on par (this is likely due to its limited parameter count, which limits the amount of knowledge it can compress).  \n\n   Model    Chatbot Arena  \n ELO Rating  \nMT Bench  \n WizardLM 13B v1.2 1047 7.2  \n Mistral 7B Instruct 1031 6.84 +/- 0.07  \n Llama 2 13B Chat 1012 6.65  \n Vicuna 13B 1041 6.57  \n Llama 2 7B Chat 985 6.27  \n Vicuna 7B 997 6.17  \n Alpaca 13B 914 4.53  \n\n Table 3: Comparison of Chat models. Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct outperforms all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B \u2013 Chat models.\n\n##  4 Instruction Finetuning\n\nTo evaluate the generalization capabilities of Mistral\u00a07B, we fine-tuned it on instruction datasets publicly available on the Hugging Face repository. No proprietary data or training tricks were utilized: Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct model is a simple and preliminary demonstration that the base model can easily be fine-tuned to achieve good performance. In Table\u00a03, we observe that the resulting model, Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct, exhibits superior performance compared to all 7B models on MT-Bench, and is comparable to 13B \u2013 Chat models. An independent human evaluation was conducted on https://llmboxing.com/leaderboard.\n\nIn this evaluation, participants were provided with a set of questions along with anonymous responses from two models and were asked to select their preferred response, as illustrated in Figure\u00a06. As of October 6, 2023, the outputs generated by Mistral 7B were preferred 5020 times, compared to 4143 times for Llama 2 13B.\n\n##  5 Adding guardrails for front-facing applications\n\nThe ability to enforce guardrails when it comes to AI generation is important for front-facing applications. In this section, we highlight how to leverage system prompting to optionally enforce output constraints on top of our models. Additionally, we showcase the ability of Mistral\u00a07B to perform fine-grained content moderation, which can be useful to enforce quality content in applications.\n\n###  5.1 System prompt to enforce guardrails\n\nWe introduce a system prompt (see below) to guide the model to generate answers within specified guardrails, similar to the work done with Llama 2. Using this prompt allows the user to move on the Pareto front of model utility / guardrails enforcement, as indicated in Table\u00a04.\n\n  Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity.\n\n   Guardrails MT Bench  \n No system prompt  6.84  0.07  \n Llama 2 system prompt  6.38  0.07  \n Mistral system prompt  6.58  0.05  \n\n Table 4: System prompts. Mean official MT Bench score over 10 iterations with standard deviation for Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct. For reference, Llama 2 13B \u2013 Chat reports official results of 6.65.\n\nWe use a set of 175 unsafe prompts for evaluating safety. With the recommended system prompt, the model properly declines to answer 100% of the harmful questions.\n\nAs an illustration, we provide in Table\u00a05 the answers of both Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct and Llama 2 Chat 13B to the question How to kill a linux process with system prompts activated. We observe that Mistral\u00a07B provides a correct response while Llama 2 declines to answer. Note that on this specific question, both models answer correctly when system prompts are deactivated.\n\n    Model Answer  \n    Mistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct  \n with Mistral system prompt  \n   To kill a Linux process, you can use the `kill`command followed by the process ID (PID)  \n of the process you want to terminate. For example, to kill process with PID 1234, you  \n would run the command `kill 1234`. It\u2019s important to note that killing a process can  \n have unintended consequences, so it\u2019s generally a good idea to only kill processes that  \n you are certain you want to terminate. Additionally, it\u2019s generally a good idea to use the  \n `kill`command with caution, as it can be used to terminate critical system processes that  \n are necessary for the operation of the system.  \n    Llama 2 13B \u2013 Chat  \n with Llama 2 system prompt  \n   As a helpful and respectful assistant, I cannot provide information on how to kill a Linux  \n process. It is not appropriate or ethical to intentionally harm or terminate processes, as it  \n can cause damage to the system and potentially result in data loss. Additionally, it is  \n important to respect the autonomy and security of other users\u2019 processes, as they may be  \n critical to their work or personal activities. Instead, I suggest that you explore other  \n options to address any issues or concerns you may have.  \nTable 5:  Comparison between Mistral and Llama system prompts. Mistral provides the right answer whereas Llama\u00a02 declines to answer to the question How to kill a linux process.   \n\n###  5.2 Content moderation with self-reflection\n\nMistral\u00a07B\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Instruct can be used as a content moderator: the model itself is able to accurately classify a user prompt or its generated answer as being either acceptable or falling into one of the following categories: Illegal activities such as terrorism, child abuse or fraud; Hateful, harassing or violent content such as discrimination, self-harm or bullying; Unqualified advice for instance in legal, medical or financial domains.\n\nTo do so, we designed a self-reflection prompt that makes Mistral\u00a07B classify a prompt or a generated answer. We evaluated self-reflection on our manually curated and balanced dataset of adversarial and standard prompts and got a precision of 99.4% for a recall of 95.6% (considering acceptable prompts as positives).\n\nThe use cases are vast, from moderating comments on social media or forums to brand monitoring on the internet. In particular, the end user is able to select afterwards which categories to effectively filter based on their particular use-case.\n\n##  6 Conclusion\n\nOur work on Mistral 7B demonstrates that language models may compress knowledge more than what was previously thought. This opens up interesting perspectives: the field has so far put the emphasis on scaling laws in 2 dimensions (directly associating model capabilities to training cost, as in hoffmann2022compute ); the problem is rather 3 dimensional (model capabilities, training cost, inference cost), and much remains to be explored to obtain the best performance with the smallest possible model.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to CoreWeave for their 24/7 help in marshalling our cluster.

word embeddings using radar charts. By arranging the 768 dimensions of BERT embeddings to maximize their correlation, we provide a more coherent and interpretable visualization without reducing dimensionality. The application of a genetic algorithm and Gaussian filters further refines our visualization approach, offering new perspectives on the semantic relationships within the embeddings.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nWord embeddings, specifically those derived from BERT models, offer a rich, high-dimensional space capturing nuanced semantic relationships. Traditional visualization techniques like PCA and t-SNE simplify these embeddings to lower dimensions, often losing significant information. Our approach, in contrast, visualizes these embeddings in their original dimensionality using radar charts, aiming to arrange dimensions based on their correlation, which enhances interpretability and preserves semantic intricacies.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Problem Complexity and Approach}\nWe address the complexity of visualizing 768-dimensional embeddings, an NP-Complete problem akin to the Travelling Salesman Problem, using a genetic algorithm. This algorithm aims to arrange each dimension next to its most correlated counterpart, optimizing the overall representation on the radar chart.\n\n\\subsection{Dimension Analysis and Treatment}\nWe analyzed the correlations between dimensions, finding most absolute correlation values between 0.3 and 0.4. To standardize these dimensions, each was centered by subtracting the mean and scaled by its standard deviation. Focusing on absolute values of correlations avoided ambiguities in interpretation.\n\n\\subsection{Gaussian Filter Application}\nGiven the low correlation values and to enhance the visualization, we applied a Gaussian filter to smooth the radar chart curves. This step was crucial in achieving clearer and more interpretable visualizations.\n\n\\section{Experiments and Results}\n\\subsection{Genetic Algorithm Application}\nAfter 250 generations, the genetic algorithm plateaued, suggesting an optimal arrangement of dimensions. This arrangement was used to generate the radar charts for word embeddings.\n\n\\subsection{Results Interpretation}\nThe radar chart visualizations yielded mixed results. While some words with similar semantic meanings showed overlapping patterns, the overall interpretations were challenging. The use of a Gaussian filter, while enhancing clarity, also introduced complexities in understanding the exact transformations or relationships depicted.\n\n\\section{Visualization}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{imgs/many_plots_first_gen.png}\n\\caption{Proximity and differences between word embeddings.}\n\\label{fig:many-plots}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{imgs/sentences_complete.png}\n\\caption{A sentence compared to itself and one word compared to that word.}\n\\label{fig:sentences_complete}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{imgs/sentence_evolution.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of sentence embeddings, word by word.}\n\\label{fig:animation}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{imgs/evolution_gaussienne.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of the shape in function of the Gaussian size.}\n\\label{fig:evolution_gaussienne}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{imgs/evolution_of_word_context.png}\n\\caption{Evolution of the shape of the word \"prince\" in function of its context (before and after).}\n\\label{fig:evolution_word_context}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\nThis paper introduced a unique approach to visualizing high-dimensional word embeddings using radar charts.

The NeurIPS style file you're using (`neurips_2020.sty`) likely has options to set the author names and mark the paper as a preprint. Here's what you should do:\n\n1. **Display Author Name:** The template may be set to anonymize submissions by default. To display your name, you need to disable this option. If the style file `neurips_2020.sty` has an option for non-anonymous submissions, you should use that. Typically, this is done by changing the `\\usepackage{neurips_2020}` line in your LaTeX file. If there's a specific option for non-anonymous submissions, it might look something like `\\usepackage[nonanon]{neurips_2020}`. However, without seeing the contents of the `neurips_2020.sty` file, I can't provide the exact command. You should check the documentation or the style file for the correct option.\n\n2. **Mark as a Preprint:** To mark the paper as a preprint, you usually add a command in the preamble of your LaTeX document. This command depends on the style file you're using. For some templates, adding `\\usepackage[preprint]{neurips_2020}` might work. Again, you should check the documentation or the style file for the correct command.\n\nHere's an example of what the beginning of your LaTeX document might look like after these changes:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage[nonanon, preprint]{neurips_2020} % Adjust according to the actual options available\n\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}\n% ... rest of your preamble ...\n\n\\title{Visualizing High-Dimensional BERT Word Embeddings Using Radar Charts}\n\\author{%\n  Your Name \\\\\n  Your Affiliation \\\\\n  \\texttt{your-email@domain.com} \\\\\n}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n% ... rest of your document ...\n```\n\nReplace `Your Name`, `Your Affiliation`, and `your-email@domain.com` with your actual details.

The optimal distance calculation, based on correlation, follows the formula \\( f(c) = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi c}{C_{max}} \\). Essentially, the function aims to position each dimension in such a way that those with high correlation are placed closer together on the radar chart, thereby minimizing the overall distance error.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{imgs/formula_dist.png}\n\\caption{Optimal distance calculation based on correlation.}\n\\label{fig:formula_dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Genetic Algorithm Components}\n\\subsubsection{Mutation Mechanism}\nThe mutation process in our genetic algorithm involves strategically relocating certain elements within a path. This is done by first selecting elements at random based on a mutation rate and then reinserting them into positions where they are more closely aligned with adjacent dimensions in terms of correlation. This approach aims to fine-tune the path by optimizing the placement of each dimension.\n\n\\subsubsection{Crossover Mechanism}\nThe crossover function combines segments from two parent paths to generate a new path. It selects a random subpath from one parent and then fills the remaining positions with dimensions from the second parent. This method ensures that the child path inherits characteristics from both parents, potentially leading to more optimal solutions.\n\n\\subsection{Gaussian Filtering Process}\nWe apply a Gaussian filter to each point in the embedding to smooth out the variations across dimensions. The filter considers a specified number of dimensions before and after the current one, encompassing a total of \\( 2N+1 \\) dimensions. This smoothing process helps in reducing noise and making the overall patterns in the data more discernible.\n\n\\subsection{Dimension Reversibility}\nIn our approach, a dimension's sign is reversed if it is negatively correlated with its preceding dimension in the path. This ensures that dimensions with negative correlations move in tandem, increasing and decreasing together. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the semantic relationships represented by the dimensions.\n\n% ...

We experimented with three different data collection methods:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Using all 30,000+ tokens known by BERT and its tokenizer.\n    \\item Extracting tokens from a set of diverse texts.\n    \\item Analyzing a single long text: \"The Little Prince\".\n\\end{enumerate}\nContrary to our hypothesis, all methods yielded similar results, with the majority of correlations falling between 0.3 and 0.4.\n\nAdditionally, we explored the impact of context on word embeddings and the evolution of sentence embeddings word by word. These experiments revealed that certain words significantly alter the resulting representation, although deciphering clear semantic meanings from the charts remains a challenge.\n\nWe also examined the effect of adding a word to the end of a sentence. Our expectation was that the representation of a sentence at time \\( t \\) would resemble that at time \\( t-1 \\), but with modifications leaning towards the word at time \\( t \\). Interestingly, we observed the opposite: the shape tends to contract in areas where significant peaks are observed in the word at time \\( t \\), and expand in areas with troughs.\n\n% ...

It provides a representation that is more faithful to the true multi-dimensional nature of these embeddings than traditional dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE, enabling a clearer perception of the proximity between words or phrases as interpreted by BERT. \n\nHowever, this method still falls short in unraveling the hidden semantics within BERT's complex embeddings. It does not necessarily offer a clearer understanding of the semantic relationships or the reasons behind the perceived closeness or distance between words or phrases according to BERT's metrics.\n\nDespite these limitations, our method retains certain properties of BERT embeddings, particularly in terms of cosine similarity between vectors, though this is slightly altered by the Gaussian filtering. The similarity seems to be partially preserved. Interestingly, the overlay of shapes in our visualizations does not always align with intuitive expectations. Words that seem semantically close may appear distant in this representation and vice versa, suggesting a disparity between human intuition and BERT's embedding logic.\n\nYet, this method opens up new avenues for interpreting the dimensions resulting from BERT and the potential modeling thereof.
